## TASK LIST

### 2) bash: 
Create a bash script to branch off from a user-selected (by date or number, counting from the first, i.e., both
as selectable options should be available) commit.
The script should use the following format: <name> <arguments>, where <arguments> are user-specified.

### 3) bash: 
Extend the script (into a new script) to parse the argument that specifies a custom output branch.
Try to implement parsing using argument specifiers, like ’-a <value>’.

### 4) bash: 
Create a script that generates ∼1 Mb worth of data in the following format: comma separated values (CSV
format) of 16 numbers per line.
Numbers must be selected randomly, i.e., all 16 × nlines numbers must differ.

### 5) bash: 
Create a new script that ’digests’ the CSV and prints an “invariant mass” for each subsequent set of four
numbers. Let’s call the line in the CSV “an event”
