## TASK LIST

### 2) Lorentz boost

Analytically prove that the Lorentz boost, in natural units, can be conveniently expressed as $β_i = \frac{p_i}{E}$

### 3) Produce the following distributions and histograms $(n = 2000)$:

a) Produce a normally distributed random variable so that the average is 125 and the width is 0.004. A particle of such (mass distribution) properties is known as the Higgs boson.

b) Let the Higgs boson decay into four particles of random masses. The Higgs boson is in its rest frame, i.e., $p^{\mu} =(125, 0, 0, 0)$. Produce (four) energy distributions of such resulting particles. For concreteness, start with Higgs decaying into two “effective” four-momenta where you have four degrees of freedom: two angles and two masses. Next, let each “effective” four-momenta decay further into two particles, where four more degrees of freedom (per pair) enter, here one angle (per pair) has a kinetic boundary. Each degree of freedom is uniformly distributed but needs to obey kinetic boundaries. Note that such “effective” four-momenta can be understood as intermediate mediators, such as Z bosons.

c) Prove by plotting that the resulting 16 random variables can be treated as four sets of four-momenta and added up to regain the Higgs mass.

d) Repeat 3b by removing five degrees of freedom: let the first “Z boson” have $m_Z = 91$ and all the final particles have the same mass of $m_{\mu} = 0.11$.
