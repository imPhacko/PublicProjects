# Trump x Biden debate generation

`ProjectTextGenRNN.pdf` presents all the results in a compact readable way.

Two jupyter notebook files include the model and used text dataset analysis (text data was personally collected from transcripted Trump x Biden debates during the 2020 presidential election period).

Feel free to retrain the model and see any fun results you can arrive at.
