# PublicProjects
This is a public repository showcasing some of my projects.

Currently not every relevant project is added. I'll do my best to keep it updated.

`ResearchWork` folder contains written formatted work in pdf and some presentations.

`high_energy_physics_analysis` folder contains tasks completed during IHEPA course, showcasing some useful results and methods.

`learning_ANN` folder contains some of my neural network study process. Contains a text generation project.

`QuantumComputing` folder has basic quantum algorithm examples. It has codes both in Python with Qiskit and in C/C++ with QuEST.

`basic_ttH_analysis_project` includes a simple regressor of invariant mass of the process using training inputs from a simulated ttH process (without further decays) using MadGraph5 software.
