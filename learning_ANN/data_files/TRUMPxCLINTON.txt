Good evening, from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I’m Moderator, anchor of NBC Nightly News. I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight’s format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90 minute debate is divided into six segments, each 50 minutes long. We’ll explore three topic areas tonight, achieving prosperity, America’s direction, and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead off question to both candidates and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we’ll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. We’ll invite you to applaud. However, at this moment, as we walk on the candidates, Democratic nominee for President of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee for President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

Hillary Clinton: (01:21)
Hey, how are you, Donald?

Moderator: (01:48)
[inaudible 00:01:48] Good luck to you. Well, I don’t expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight. But I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important. And we’re going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates. And just as important to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So let’s begin. We’re calling this opening segment, achieving prosperity and central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There’s been a record, six straight years of job growth and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation, however, income inequality remains significant and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton. Why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American workers?

Hillary Clinton: (02:51)
Thank you, Lester and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we’ll build together. Today is my granddaughter’s second birthday so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs and infrastructure in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women’s work. I also want to see more companies do profit sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.

Hillary Clinton: (03:56)
And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I’ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you’re under. So let’s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let’s be sure we have affordable childcare and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? We’re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it’s good to be with you. We’re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us. Who can shoulder the immense awesome responsibilities of the presidency? Who can put into action the plans that will make your life better? I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.

Moderator: (04:55)
Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It’s about putting money, more money, into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.

Donald Trump: (05:02)
Thank you. Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They’re devaluing their currency and there’s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight, because they’re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we’re losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what’s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said, it’s the eighth wonder of the world, that building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that. Their small car division leaving, thousands of jobs. Leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio, they’re all leaving, and we can’t allow it to happen anymore.

Donald Trump: (05:59)
As far as childcare is concerned. And so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we’re going to do, but perhaps we’ll be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and with it firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier Air Conditioning in Indianapolis, they fired 1400 people. They’re going to Mexico. So many, hundreds and hundreds, of companies are doing this. We can not let it happen.

Donald Trump: (06:39)
Under my plan, I’ll be reducing taxes tremendously from 35% to 15% for companies, small and big businesses, that’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan, it’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build, they will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.

Moderator: (07:11)
Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?

Hillary Clinton: (07:13)
Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5% of the world’s population. We have to trade with the other 95% and we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also though need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions and the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version. The biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we’ve ever had. I call it trumped up, trickle down because that’s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what’s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.

Hillary Clinton: (08:06)
I understand that. Donald was very fortunate in his life and that’s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off we’ll be and that everything will work out from there. I don’t buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silk screen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle-class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we’ll grow. That’s the kind of economy I want us to see again.

Moderator: (08:56)
Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can. You’ve talked about creating 25 million jobs and you’ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are we going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How specifically are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back.

Donald Trump: (09:13)
Well, for one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975. And I built it into a company that’s worth many, many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world. And I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country’s in deep trouble. We don’t know what we’re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China, they’re the best, the best ever, at it. What they’re doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And Lester, they’re taking our jobs. They’re giving incentives. They’re doing things that frankly we don’t do.

Donald Trump: (09:52)
Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We’re on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there’s a tax. When they sell an automatic 16%, approximately. When they sell into us, there’s no tax. It’s a defective agreement. It’s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven’t done anything about it.

Donald Trump: (10:13)
Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, I guess. Is that okay? Good. I want you to be very happy. It’s very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently, she’s been doing this for 30 years and why hasn’t she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective, just because of the tax and many other reasons. But just because of the tax.

Moderator: (10:38)
Let me interrupt at just a moment.

Donald Trump: (10:39)
Secretary Clinton and others, politicians should have been doing this for years. Not right now because of the fact that we’ve created a movement, they should have been doing this for years. What’s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester.

Moderator: (11:02)
Back to the question though, how do you bring back specifically, bring back jobs? American manufacturers, how do you make them bring the jobs back?

Donald Trump: (11:09)
Well, the first thing you do is don’t let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them, they’re leaving and they’re leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say fine. You want to go to Mexico with some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you’re wrong. And once you say you’re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave because in many cases they own the companies. So what I’m saying is we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that’s a big, big factor.

Moderator: (11:52)
Let me let Secretary Clinton [crosstalk 00:11:53].

Hillary Clinton: (11:54)
Well, let’s stop for a second. And remember where we were eight years ago, we had the worst financial crisis, the great recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said back in 2006, “Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.” Well, it did collapse.

Donald Trump: (12:33)
That’s called business [crosstalk 00:12:34].

Hillary Clinton: (12:34)
9 million people, 9 million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now we have come back from that abyss and it has not been easy. So we’re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy. But the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what I’ve proposed and looked at what Donald’s proposed. And basically they’ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would, in some instances, disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy were to go into effect, we would lose three and a half million jobs and maybe have another recession. They’ve looked at my plans and they’ve said, “Okay, if we can do this,” and I intend to get it done, “we will have 10 million more new jobs,” because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it’s real.

Donald Trump: (13:58)
I did not. I do not say that. [crosstalk 00:13:58]

Hillary Clinton: (13:58)
I think it’s important that we grip this and deal with it both at home and abroad. And here’s what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That’s a lot of jobs. That’s a lot of new economic activity. So I’ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do. And I am determined that we’re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we’ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.

Moderator: (14:33)
Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (14:33)
She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country, that was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now look, I’m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we’re putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can’t do what you’re looking to do with 20 trillion in debt.

Donald Trump: (14:59)
The Obama administration, from the time they’ve come in, is over 230 years worth of debt. And he’s topped it. He’s doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven and a half years to be semi exact. So I will tell you this, we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentive to build new companies or to expand because they’re not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving. They’re gone. And Hillary, I just ask you this, you’ve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years you’ve been doing it and now you’re just starting to think of solutions. [crosstalk 00:15:53] I will bring, excuse me, I will bring back jobs. You can’t bring back jobs.

Hillary Clinton: (15:58)
Actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.

Donald Trump: (16:01)
Yeah, for 30 years.

Hillary Clinton: (16:02)
I have, well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again. [crosstalk 00:16:12] new jobs.

Donald Trump: (16:12)
He approved NAFTA. [crosstalk 00:16:14].

Hillary Clinton: (16:13)
Balanced budgets.

Donald Trump: (16:13)
Which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.

Hillary Clinton: (16:18)
[crosstalk 00:16:18] incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we’re actually going to look at the facts. When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them, I voted for. The biggest one, a multi-national one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals, but let’s not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it. And I’ve said what I’m going to do. I’m going to have a special prosecutor. We’re going to enforce the trade deals we have. And we’re going to hold people accountable. When I was Secretary of State, we actually increased American exports globally, 30%. We increased them to China, 50%. So I know how to really work, to get new jobs and to get exports that help to create more new jobs.

Moderator: (17:23)
Very quickly-

Donald Trump: (17:23)
Well, you haven’t done it in 30 years or 26 years [crosstalk 00:17:27].

Hillary Clinton: (17:26)
Well, I’ve been a Senator [crosstalk 00:00:17:28].

Donald Trump: (17:28)
You haven’t done it.

Hillary Clinton: (17:32)
I have been a Secretary of State and I have done [crosstalk 00:17:32]

Donald Trump: (17:32)
Your husband signed NAFTA side, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.

Hillary Clinton: (17:37)
Well, that’s your opinion. That is your opinion.

Donald Trump: (17:38)
You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton and you will see devastation where manufacturers is down 30, 40, sometimes 50%. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve transpacific partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is. And you said, I can’t win that debate, but you know that if you did win, you would approve that. And that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.

Hillary Clinton: (18:10)
That is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in-

Donald Trump: (18:20)
You called it the gold standard. [crosstalk 00:18:23] You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said, it’s the finest deal you’ve ever seen. And then you heard what I said about it. And all of a sudden you were against it.

Hillary Clinton: (18:31)
Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated, which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn’t. I wrote about that-

Donald Trump: (18:46)
So is it President Obama’s fault? [crosstalk 00:18:46] Is it President Obama’s fault?

Hillary Clinton: (18:47)
Before it was even announced [crosstalk 00:00:18:51].

Donald Trump: (18:51)
Secretary, is it President Obama’s fault? Because he’s pushing it.

Hillary Clinton: (18:55)
There are different views about what’s good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it’s important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That’s why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt [crosstalk 00:19:15]

Donald Trump: (19:14)
But you have no plan.

Hillary Clinton: (19:16)
Educate. Oh, I do.

Donald Trump: (19:17)
Secretary, you have no plan.

Hillary Clinton: (19:19)
I have written a book about it. It’s called Stronger Together. You can pick it up tomorrow [crosstalk 00:19:23] at a bookstore or at an airport near you.

Moderator: (19:26)
We’re going to-

Hillary Clinton: (19:27)
But it’s because I see this. We need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities of business. So we have a very robust set of plans and people have looked at both of our plans have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us three and a half million jobs [crosstalk 00:19:54]

Donald Trump: (19:54)
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you’re going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I’m very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs, but regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. When I go around, Lester, I tell you this I’ve been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the things that businesses and people like the most is the fact that I’m cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business and you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse. I’m going to cut regulations, but I’m going to cut taxes, big league, and you’re going to raise taxes, big league. End of story.

Moderator: (20:54)
Let me get you to pause right there because we’re going to move [crosstalk 00:20:56] and then we’re going to move into the next segment. We’re going to-

Hillary Clinton: (20:58)
That can’t be left. [ crosstalk 00:21:01].

Moderator: (21:02)
Take 30 seconds [crosstalk 00:21:02]

Hillary Clinton: (21:02)
I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims.

Donald Trump: (21:06)
Facts.

Hillary Clinton: (21:06)
And so we have taken the homepage of my website, hillaryclinton.com, and we’ve turned it into a fact checker. So if you want to see in real time, what the facts are, please go and take a look because-

Donald Trump: (21:21)
And take a look at mine also and you’ll see.

Hillary Clinton: (21:22)
[crosstalk 00:21:22] Not add a penny to the debt and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it’s time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.

Moderator: (21:50)
Well, you just opened the next segment [crosstalk 00:21:52]

Donald Trump: (21:51)
Well, can I just finish? I think I should [crosstalk 00:21:54] You go to her website [crosstalk 00:21:58] she’s going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion-

Moderator: (22:01)
Mr. Trump [crosstalk 00:22:01].

Donald Trump: (22:01)
… and look at her website. You know what? It’s no different than this. She’s telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to our website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don’t think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.

Moderator: (22:12)
So the next segment we’re continuing on the subject of-

Hillary Clinton: (22:16)
Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.

Donald Trump: (22:18)
No, no you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do.

Hillary Clinton: (22:21)
No, we’re not.

Donald Trump: (22:21)
See you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you’ve been fighting. No wonder you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.

Moderator: (22:30)
Folks, [crosstalk 00:22:32]

Hillary Clinton: (22:31)
Go to the, please, the fact checkers. Get to work.

Moderator: (22:34)
Okay, you were unpacking a lot here and we’re still in the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy. Secretary Clinton, you’re calling for a tax increase in the wealthiest Americans. I’d like you to further defend that. And Mr. Trump, you’re calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I’d like you to defend that. And this next two minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (22:56)
Well, I’m really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. They’re going to expand their companies. They’re going to do a tremendous job. I’m getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it’s not a tax, it’s really not a great thing for the wealthy, it’s a great thing for middle-class. It’s a great thing for companies to expand. And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they’re going to bring two and a half trillion dollars back from overseas, where they can’t bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton, won’t allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is what is so bad.

Donald Trump: (23:35)
So what they’re doing is they’re leaving our country and their, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high. And because some of them have lots of money outside of our country and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they can’t work out a deal too, and everybody agrees it should be brought back, instead of that, they’re leaving our country to get their money because they can’t bring their money back into our country because of bureaucratic red tape. Because they can’t get together. Because we have a-

Donald Trump: (24:03)
[inaudible 00:24:00] red tape because they can’t get together… Because we have a president that can’t sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And here’s the thing, Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done. Two and a half trillion, I happen to think it’s double that.

Donald Trump: (24:15)
It’s probably $5 trillion that we can bring into our country, Lester, and with a little leadership, you’d get it in here very quickly. And it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly that starts with Secretary Clinton.

Moderator: (24:34)
All right. You have two minutes on the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton?

Hillary Clinton: (24:40)
I have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I’m going to be blamed for everything that’s ever happened.

Donald Trump: (24:45)
Why not?

Hillary Clinton: (24:45)
Why not? Yeah. Why not? Join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now let me say this, it is absolutely the case-

Donald Trump: (24:57)
Hey, there’s nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.

Moderator: (25:00)
This is Secretary Clinton’s two minutes, please.

Hillary Clinton: (25:02)
… Yeah. Well, let’s start the clock again, Lester. We’ve looked at your tax proposals. I don’t see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you’re referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that’s stranded overseas. I happen to support that.

Donald Trump: (25:23)
Then you didn’t read it.

Hillary Clinton: (25:24)
I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You’ve proposed a-

Donald Trump: (25:42)
Who gave it that name?

Hillary Clinton: (25:44)
… an approach that has a [crosstalk 00:25:44] $4 billion tax benefit-

Moderator: (25:47)
This is Secretary Clinton’s two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (25:47)
… for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing-

Donald Trump: (25:50)
How much for my family?

Hillary Clinton: (25:52)
… it is-

Donald Trump: (25:52)
Lester, how much?

Hillary Clinton: (25:53)
… as I said, trumped up, trickle down. Trickle down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and ’09. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn’t worked. And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, “Hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.” I don’t think top-down works in America.

Hillary Clinton: (26:20)
I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education. Helping people refinance their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.

Mr. Trump, we’re-

Donald Trump: (26:47)
Typical politician. All talk. No action. Sounds good. Doesn’t work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions, in terms of our jobs, and in terms of what’s going on. Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression and believe me, we’re in a bubble right now.

Donald Trump: (27:14)
And the only thing that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that’s going to come crashing down. We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble, and we better be awfully careful. And we have a fed that’s doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the fed, the fed is doing political by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me, the day Obama goes off and he leaves, and he goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you’re going to see some very bad things happen because the fed is not doing their job. The fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.

Moderator: (27:52)
Mr. Trump, we’re talking about the burden that Americans have to pay. Yet, you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is that voters will know if their potential president owes money to who owes it to, and any business conflicts. Don’t Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?

Donald Trump: (28:13)
I don’t mind releasing. I’m under a routine audit, and it will be released. And as soon as the audit is finished, it will be released. But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections where I filed a 104 page, essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have, it shows income. In fact, the income, I just looked today, the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would’ve told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.

Donald Trump: (28:46)
But that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that’s doing so badly, that’s being ripped off by every single country in the world, it’s the kind of thinking that our country needs. Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means who’s negotiating these trade deals? We have people that are political hacks, negotiating our trade deal.

Moderator: (29:18)
The IRS says-

Donald Trump: (29:18)
Excuse me.

Moderator: (29:19)
… an audit of your taxes… You’re perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public has a right to know outweigh your personal [crosstalk 00:05:28]?

Donald Trump: (29:28)
Well, I told you I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I’ve been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, “You get audited?” I get audited almost every year. And in a way, I should be complaining. I’m not even complaining. I don’t mind it. It’s almost become a way of life.

Donald Trump: (29:45)
I get audited by the IRS, but other people don’t. I will say this: we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns against my lawyers’ wishes when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release my tax returns and that’s against my lawyers. They say, “Don’t do it.”

Donald Trump: (30:14)
I will tell you this. No, in fact, watching shows, reading the papers, almost every lawyer says, “You don’t release your returns until the audit is complete.” When the audit is complete, I’ll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her emails.

Moderator: (30:29)
So it’s negotiable?

Donald Trump: (30:31)
It’s not negotiable. No. Let her release the… Why did she delete 33,000?

Moderator: (30:35)
I’ll let her ask that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement, we did ask you to be silent. So it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (30:43)
Well, I think you’ve just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear, there is no prohibition on releasing it when you’re under audit.

Hillary Clinton: (31:04)
So you’ve got to ask yourself, “Why won’t he release his tax returns?” And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First: maybe he’s not as rich as he says he is. Second: maybe he’s not as charitable as he claims to be. Third: we don’t know all of his business dealings, but we have been told, through investigative reporting, that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.

Hillary Clinton: (31:33)
Or maybe he doesn’t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody’s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn’t pay any federal income tax. So if he’s paid-

Donald Trump: (31:55)
That makes me smart.

Hillary Clinton: (31:55)
… zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he’s not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible that he’s trying to hide. And the financial disclosure statement, they don’t give you the tax rate. They don’t give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.

Hillary Clinton: (32:30)
And I have no reason to believe that he’s ever going to release his tax returns because there’s something he’s hiding, and we’ll guess, we’ll keep guessing at what it might be that he’s hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.

Moderator: (32:58)
He also raised the issue of your emails. Do you want to respond to that?

Hillary Clinton: (33:01)
I do. I made a mistake using a private email.

Donald Trump: (33:06)
That’s for sure.

Hillary Clinton: (33:06)
And if I had to do it over again, I would obviously do it differently. But I’m not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.

Moderator: (33:17)
Mr. Trump?

Donald Trump: (33:19)
That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. Okay. That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the fifth amendment, taking the fifth so they’re not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server, taking the fifth, I think it’s disgraceful. And believe me, this country really thinks it’s disgraceful also.

Donald Trump: (33:44)
As far as my tax returns, you don’t learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing. I’m extremely under leveraged. The report that said 650, which by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business said, “Boy, that’s really not a lot of money.” It’s not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was actually, it wasn’t even a bad story, to be honest with you. But the buildings are worth $3.9 billion, and the 650 isn’t even on that, but it’s not 650.

Donald Trump: (34:19)
It’s much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks. If that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These a very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very under leveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way, it’s because it’s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.

Donald Trump: (34:44)
Where we have $20 trillion in debt and our country’s a mess… It’s one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good, and our bridges are good, and everything’s in great shape. Our airports, our airports are from a third world country. You land at LaGuardia. You land at Kennedy. You land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see this incredible… You come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land, we’ve become a third world country.

Donald Trump: (35:13)
So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion and we’re a mess. We haven’t even started. And we’ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw, whether it’s six or five, but it looks like it’s six. $ 6 trillion in the Middle East. We could’ve rebuilt our country twice. And it’s really a shame. And it’s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We’re a debtor nation. We’re a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don’t have the money because it’s been squandered on so many of your ideas.

Moderator: (35:57)
Let your respond and we’ll move to a next-

Hillary Clinton: (35:59)
And maybe because you haven’t paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. And the other thing I think is important to point out-

Donald Trump: (36:06)
It would be squandered, too. Believe me.

Hillary Clinton: (36:07)
… is if your main claim to be President of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. Your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys. And indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I’ve met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers like my dad was who you refuse to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do. We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It’s a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use, and you wouldn’t pay what the man needed to be paid what he was charging you to do.

Donald Trump: (37:05)
Maybe he didn’t do a good job, and I was unsatisfied with his work.

Hillary Clinton: (37:08)
Well do thousands-

Donald Trump: (37:09)
Which our country should do, too.

Hillary Clinton: (37:10)
… Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refuse to pay them? I can only say that I’m certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.

Hillary Clinton: (37:39)
And when we talk about your business, you’ve taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great business people that have never taken bankruptcy. Once you call yourself the King of debt. You talk about leverage you even at one time, suggested that you would try to negotiate down the-

Donald Trump: (38:01)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (38:01)
… national debt of the United States.

Donald Trump: (38:04)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (38:04)
Well, sometimes there’s not a direct transfer of skills from business to government. But sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.

Moderator: (38:16)
Let’s let Mr. Trump respond.

Hillary Clinton: (38:16)
And we need to be very clear about that.

Donald Trump: (38:19)
I do think it’s done. Look, it’s all words. It’s all sound soundbites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets, anywhere in the world, beyond the United States and Europe, lots of different places. It’s an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn’t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taking advantage of the laws of the nation.

Donald Trump: (38:53)
Now, if you want to change the laws, you’ve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation, because I’m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that’s what I do. But what she doesn’t say is the tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.

Donald Trump: (39:16)
I’ll give you an example. We’re just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House. So if I don’t get there one way, I’m going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. But we’re opening the old post office under budget, ahead of schedule, save tremendous money. I’m a year ahead of schedule. And that’s what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they’re supposed to cost.

Donald Trump: (39:44)
We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they was supposed to be because we don’t have people that know what they’re doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad, to a large extent, because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.

Moderator: (40:11)
Well, we’re well behind schedule. So I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America’s direction. And let’s start by talking about race. The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it’s been in decades. Much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we’ve seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign. And one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.

Hillary Clinton: (40:42)
Well, you’re right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and yes, it determines how they’re treated in the criminal justice system.

Hillary Clinton: (41:05)
We’ve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. And we’ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they’re well-prepared to use force only when necessary.

Hillary Clinton: (41:37)
Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. Right now, that’s not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I’ve laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.

Hillary Clinton: (42:01)
But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we’ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.

Hillary Clinton: (42:24)
The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities, and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we’re seeing today.

Moderator: (42:49)
All right. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide?

Donald Trump: (42:52)
Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn’t want to use a couple of words, and that’s law and order. And we need law and order. If we don’t have it, we’re not going to have a country. And when I look at what’s going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments.

Donald Trump: (43:10)
When I look at what’s going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it’s… I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long. We need law and order in our country. And I just got today, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group. I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities,

Donald Trump: (43:42)
African-Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they’ve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I’m saying, where is this? Is this a war torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years.

Donald Trump: (44:15)
In fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president over four, almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now whether or not in a place like Chicago, you do stop and frisk, which worked very well. Mayor Giuliani is here. It worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you’d take the gun away from criminals that shouldn’t be having it.

Donald Trump: (44:41)
We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they’re illegally here, illegal immigrants, and they have guns and they should people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to know what we’re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities because African-American communities are being decimated by crime. Decimated.

Moderator: (45:09)
Your two minutes has expired. But I do want to follow up. Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.

Donald Trump: (45:19)
No. You’re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would’ve won on appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places it works a lot.

Moderator: (45:37)
The argument is that it’s a form of racial profiling.

Donald Trump: (45:40)
No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn’t have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn’t be… When you have 3,000 shootings Chicago from January 1st. When you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop and frisk.

Donald Trump: (46:07)
You need more police. You need a better community relation. You don’t have good community relations in Chicago, it’s terrible. I have property there. It’s terrible what’s going on in Chicago. But when you look, and Chicago is not the only. You go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.

Donald Trump: (46:29)
You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases it’s not good. But you look at Dallas where the relationships were really studied. The relationships were really a beautiful thing. And then five police officers were killed one night, very violently. So there’s some bad things going on, some really bad things.

Moderator: (46:52)
Secretary Clinton, [crosstalk 00:22:53].

Donald Trump: (46:53)
Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities because the people that are most effected by what’s happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it’s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.

Moderator: (47:10)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (47:11)
Well, I’ve heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it’s really unfortunate that he paints such a dire, negative picture of black communities in our country. The vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There’s a lot that we should be proud of, and we should be supporting and lifting up. But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop and frisk was found to be unconstitutional. And in part, because it was ineffective, it did not do-

Hillary Clinton: (48:03)
Because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. Now, I believe in community policing, and in fact, violent crime is one half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40%. We just don’t want to see it creep back up. We’ve had 25 years of very good cooperation, but there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African American and Latino men ended up in jail for non-violent offenses. And it’s just a fact that if you’re a young African American man, and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we’ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.

Hillary Clinton: (48:54)
We cannot just say law and order. We have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. We need to have more second chance programs. I’m glad that we’re ending private prisons in the federal system. I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn’t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.

Hillary Clinton: (49:31)
And I believe strongly that common sense gun safety measures would assist us right now. And this is something Donald has supported along with the gun lobby. Right now, we’ve got too many military style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm, and we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who’s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you’re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.

Moderator: (50:15)
Secretary Clinton, last week you said, “We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.” Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?

Hillary Clinton: (50:26)
Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore I think we need, all of us, to be asking hard questions about why am I feeling this way? But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.

Hillary Clinton: (51:04)
I’ve met with a group of very distinguished experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it’s an issue. They’ve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.

Donald Trump: (51:31)
I’d like to respond to that.

Moderator: (51:32)
Please.

Donald Trump: (51:33)
First of all, I agree. And a lot of people, even within my own party, want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I’m very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they’re protecting the Second Amendment, but I think we have to look very strongly at no fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn’t be on there, we’ll help them. We’ll help them legally. We’ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.

Donald Trump: (52:05)
I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the word super predator about young black youth. And that’s a term that I think t’s been horribly met as you know, I think you’ve apologized for it, but I think it was a terrible thing to say.

Donald Trump: (52:22)
And when it comes to stop and frisk, you’re talking about taking guns away. Well, I’m talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. I really don’t think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there’s a political reason why you can’t say it, but I really don’t believe. In New York City, stop and frisk, we had 2,200 murders and stop and frisk brought it down to 500 murders. 500 murder’s a lot of murders, hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500 and it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. It was terminated by our current mayor, but stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.

Hillary Clinton: (53:11)
Well, it’s also fair to say, if we’re going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor crime has continued to drop including murders.

Donald Trump: (53:19)
Well, you’re wrong, you’re wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (53:21)
No, I’m not.

Donald Trump: (53:22)
Murders are up. All right, you check it.

Hillary Clinton: (53:23)
New York has done-

Donald Trump: (53:25)
You check it.

Hillary Clinton: (53:25)
… an excellent job, and I give credit. I give credit across the board going back to mayors, to police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work as well. Look, one murder is too many-

Donald Trump: (53:42)
True.

Hillary Clinton: (53:43)
.. but it is important that we learn about what has been effective and not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with neighborhoods safe? But let’s also add no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working again with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.

Moderator: (54:21)
This conversation is about race, and so Mr. Trump, I have to ask you-

Donald Trump: (54:23)
But I’d like to just respond, if I might?

Donald Trump: (54:28)
Look, the African American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, “See you later. I’ll see you in four years.” Look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They’ve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that’s what it is. They’ve controlled these communities for up to a hundred years-

Moderator: (54:58)
Mr. Trump, let me-

Donald Trump: (55:00)
… unbroken. And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities and I just left Detroit and I just left Philadelphia, and you know, you’ve seen me. I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that’s okay. But I will tell you, I’ve been all over, and I’ve met some of the greatest people I’ll ever meet within these communities, and they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.

Moderator: (55:25)
Mr. Trump-

Hillary Clinton: (55:25)

Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation’s first black president was not a natural born citizen. You question his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledge what most Americans have accepted for years. The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?

Donald Trump: (55:58)
I’ll tell you. Well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and very close friend of Secretary Clinton and her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard and you can go look it up and you can check it out. And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn’t fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I’m satisfied with it. And I’ll tell you why I’m satisfied with it-

Moderator: (56:54)
That was a [crosstalk 00:56:55].

Donald Trump: (56:55)
… because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get onto creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.

Moderator: (57:08)
I will let you respond. It’s important, but I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You continued to tell the story and question the president’s legitimacy in 2012, ’13, ’14, ’15-

Donald Trump: (57:20)
Yeah.

Moderator: (57:20)
… as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind?

Donald Trump: (57:24)
Well, nobody was pressing it. Nobody was caring much about it. I figured you’d ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got them to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it. Now everybody in mainstream’s going to say, “Oh, that’s not true.” Look, it’s true. Sidney Blumenthal sent the reporter. You just have to take a look at CNN the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager, and she was involved. But just like she can’t bring back jobs, she can’t produce.

Moderator: (58:01)
I’m sorry, I’m just going to follow up and I will let you respond to that because there’s a lot there, but we’re talking about racial healing in this segment, what do you say to Americans who are people of color [crosstalk 00:58:10]

Donald Trump: (58:09)
I say nothing, I say nothing, because I was able to get them to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing. But let me just tell you, when you talk about healing, I think that I’ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African American community. I think you can see that. And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service, not only for the country, but even for the president in getting him to produce his birth certificate.

Moderator: (58:41)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (58:43)
Well, just listen to what you heard. And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Moderator was going to be asking us questions. So he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed, but it can’t be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted. He persisted year after year because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.

Hillary Clinton: (59:34)
But remember, Donald started his career back in 1973, being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination, because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African Americans. And he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.

Hillary Clinton: (01:00:08)
And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. Barack Obama is a man of great dignity, and I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention. “When they go low, we go high,” and Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump’s best efforts to bring him down.

Moderator: (01:00:44)
Mr. Trump, you can respond, then we’re going to move on to the next segment.

Donald Trump: (01:00:47)
I’d love to respond. First of all, I got to watch, in preparing for this, some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. Doesn’t work that way. You were after him. You even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don’t think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work. It really does.

Donald Trump: (01:01:20)
Now, as far as the lawsuit. Yes, when I was very young, I went into my father’s company. He had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we along with many, many other companies throughout the country, it was a federal lawsuit, were sued. We settled the suit with zero, with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do, but they sued many people. I noticed you bring that up a lot. And I also noticed the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don’t do on you. Maybe I’m trying to save the money, but frankly, I look at that and I say, “Isn’t that amazing?” Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms. And it’s just one of those things.

Donald Trump: (01:02:05)
I’ll go on one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African Americans, against Muslims, against anybody, and it’s a tremendously successful club. I’m so glad I did it, and I have been given great credit for what I did. And I’m very, very proud of it. And that’s the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.

Moderator: (01:02:44)
Our next segment is called securing America. We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is who’s behind it and how do we fight it? Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.

Hillary Clinton: (01:03:02)
Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare, will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president because clearly we’re facing at this point, two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money.

Hillary Clinton: (01:03:25)
But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There’s no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country. And I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald’s praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really tough, long game here. And one of the things he’s done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we’ve recently have learned that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.

Hillary Clinton: (01:04:19)
We need to make it very clear whether it’s Russia, China, Iran, or anybody else, the United States has much greater capacity, and we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private sector information or our public sector information. And we’re going to have to make it clear that we don’t want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don’t want to engage in a different kind of warfare, but we will defend the citizens of this country. And the Russians need to understand that. I think they’ve been treating it as almost a probing. How far would we go? How much will we do? And that’s why I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That that is just unacceptable. It’s one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican administration-

Moderator: (01:05:20)
Two minutes have expired.

Hillary Clinton: (01:05:21)
… have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander-in-chief. It’s comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.

Moderator: (01:05:30)
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes in the same question. Who’s behind it, and how do we fight it?

Donald Trump: (01:05:32)
Yeah, I do want to say that I was just endorsed and more are coming next week, it will be over 200 admirals, many of them are here, admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened and many more are coming. And I’m very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. I’ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed 16,500 Border Patrol agents.

Donald Trump: (01:06:03)
So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I’ll take the admirals, and I’ll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. Okay? Because look at the mess that we’re in. Look at the mess that we’re in.

Donald Trump: (01:06:19)
As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else and perhaps we’re not. I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She’s saying Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe it was, I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. You don’t know who broke in to DNC, but what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That’s what it was.

Donald Trump: (01:07:01)
Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country. We don’t know because the truth is, under President Obama, we’ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the internet. We came up with the internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the internet, they’re beating us at our own game. ISIS.

Donald Trump: (01:07:26)
So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is a huge problem. I have a son, he’s 10 years old, he has computers. He is so good with these computers. It’s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it’s hardly doable, but I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing, but that’s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.

Moderator: (01:07:59)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:08:00)
Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa and their claim of being a caliphate. We’re making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq, and we’re hoping that within the year, we’ll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq, and then really squeeze them in Syria.

Hillary Clinton: (01:08:59)
But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they’ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons. So we have to make this the top priority. And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaeda leadership when I was Secretary of State, including of course taking out Bin Ladin. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi as well, make that one of our organizing principles, because we’ve got to defeat ISIS, and we’ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.

Moderator: (01:09:39)
You mentioned ISIS and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I’ll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (01:10:05)
Well, first, I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. We will take out ISIS. Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out.They shouldn’t have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster and ISIS was formed.

Donald Trump: (01:10:27)
So she talks about taking them out. She’s been doing it a long time. She’s been trying to take them out for a long time, but they wouldn’t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn’t have had them, or as I’ve been saying for a long time, and I think you’ll agree because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil, and we should have taken the oil, ISIS would not have been able to form either because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil, a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.

Moderator: (01:11:05)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:11:06)
Well, I hope the fact checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq-

Donald Trump: (01:11:15)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (01:11:15)
That is absolutely-

Donald Trump: (01:11:17)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (01:11:17)
… proved over and over again.

Donald Trump: (01:11:19)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (01:11:19)
He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out after actually doing some business with them one time. But the larger point, he says this constantly, is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then Iraqi government that would have protected our troops. And the Iraqi government would not give that. But let’s talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is what do we do here in the United States? That’s the most important-

Hillary Clinton: (01:12:03)
… you asked, Lester. The question you asked is what do we do here in the United States? That’s the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? And I think we’ve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.

Hillary Clinton: (01:12:16)
I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. They responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami, and they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.

Hillary Clinton: (01:12:38)
We’ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we’ve got to work more closely with our allies. And that’s something that Donald has been very dismissive of. We’re working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We’re working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. They’re on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald’s rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.

Moderator: (01:13:37)
Mr.-

Donald Trump: (01:13:37)
Oh, well, I’d have to respond.

Moderator: (01:13:39)
Please respond.

Donald Trump: (01:13:41)
The secretary said, very strongly about working with. We’ve been working with them for many years and we have the greatest mess anyone’s ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it’s a total mess, under your direction to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East. You started the Iran deal, that’s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall. I mean, they were doing so badly, they were choking on the sanctions and now they’re going to be actually probably a major power at some point, pretty soon, the way they’re going.

Donald Trump: (01:14:09)
But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? Now, you have to understand, I’m a business person. I did really well, but I have common sense. And I said, “Well, I’ll tell you, I haven’t given lots of thought to NATO, but two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren’t paying their fair share,” and that bothers me because we should be asked… We’re defending them and they should at least be paying us what they’re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And number two, I said and very strongly, “NATO could be obsolete,” and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times to be honest. But I said, “They do not focus on terror,” and I was very strong and I said it numerous times.

Donald Trump: (01:14:57)
And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that’s great. And I think we should get… Because we pay approximately 73% of the cost of NATO. It’s a lot of money to protect other people, but I’m all for NATO. But I said, they have to focus on terror also. And they’re going to do that. Believe me, I’m sure I’m not going to get credit for it. But that was largely because of what I was saying, and my criticism of NATO.

Donald Trump: (01:15:28)
I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS and we have to do it fast. When ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton… And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn’t believe it. They sat back probably and said, “I can’t believe it, they said-

Hillary Clinton: (01:15:54)
Well, Lester, we’ve covered-

Donald Trump: (01:15:54)
No, wait a minute.

Hillary Clinton: (01:15:54)
We’ve covered this ground.

Donald Trump: (01:15:56)
When they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now you’re talking about taking out ISIS, but you were there and you were Secretary of State when it was a little infant. Now it’s an over 30 countries, and you’re going to stop them? I don’t think so.

Moderator: (01:16:13)
Mr. Trump, lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your judgement-

Donald Trump: (01:16:20)
I did not support the war in Iraq-

Moderator: (01:16:22)
… 2002-

Donald Trump: (01:16:23)
That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she, frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.

Moderator: (01:16:31)
My question is, since you supported it, why is your judgment [crosstalk 01:16:35].

Donald Trump: (01:16:32)
Would you like to hear? I was against the war… Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out.

Moderator: (01:16:39)
The record shows otherwise-

Donald Trump: (01:16:40)
The record does not show that.

Moderator: (01:16:41)
Why is your judgment any-

Donald Trump: (01:16:41)
The record shows that I’m right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone’s asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don’t know, maybe. Who knows, essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox, and Sean Hannity said… And he called me the other day. And I spoke to him about it. He said, “You were totally against the war,” because he was for the war.

Moderator: (01:17:16)
Why is your judgment better than-

Donald Trump: (01:17:17)
Wait. Excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people, he’s willing to say, but nobody wants to call him, I was against the war. He said, “You used to have fights with me,” because Sean was in favor of the war. And I understand that side also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody calls Sean Hannity.

Donald Trump: (01:17:39)
Then they did an article in a major magazine shortly after the war started, I think in ’04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq. And one of your compatriots said, “Whether it was before or right after, Trump was definite.” Because if you read this article, there’s no doubt. But if somebody and I’ll ask the press, if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started, he and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it’s a terrible and a stupid thing. It’s going to destabilize the Middle East, and that’s exactly what it’s done. It’s been a disaster.

Moderator: (01:18:14)
My reference was to what you had said in 2002.

Donald Trump: (01:18:17)
Then you didn’t hear what I said.

Moderator: (01:18:17)
And my question was why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton’s?

Donald Trump: (01:18:22)
Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There’s no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has. I have a much better. Let me tell you, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising. They get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names. Oh, temperament, let’s go after it. I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is by temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have-

Moderator: (01:18:49)
Secretary Clinton-

Donald Trump: (01:18:50)
Wait. The AFL CIO, the other, day behind the blue screen, I don’t know who you were talking to Secretary Clinton, but you was totally out of control. I said, “There’s a person with a temperament that’s got a problem.”

Moderator: (01:19:05)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:19:06)
Okay. Let’s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald. First, NATO. NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this, an attack on one is an attack on all. And do you know the only time it’s ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.

Hillary Clinton: (01:19:47)
With respect to Iran, when I became Secretary of State, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn’t enough.

Hillary Clinton: (01:20:14)
So I spent a year and a half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China, to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran, and we did drive them to the negotiating table. My successor, John Kerry and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran’s nuclear program, without firing a single shot. That’s diplomacy, that’s coalition-building, that’s working with other nations.

Hillary Clinton: (01:20:44)
The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, “You know, if they taunted our sailors, I’d blow them out of the water and start another war.” That’s not good judgment.

Donald Trump: (01:21:06)
That would not start a war.

Hillary Clinton: (01:21:07)
That is not the right temperament to be commander in chief, to be taunted.

Donald Trump: (01:21:13)
No, they were taunting us.

Hillary Clinton: (01:21:13)
And the worst part of what Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn’t care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, “Well, if there were a nuclear war in the East Asia, well, that’s fine. Have a good time folks.”

Donald Trump: (01:21:45)
That’s lies.

Hillary Clinton: (01:21:45)
And in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number one threat we face in the world, and it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.

Donald Trump: (01:22:14)
That line is getting a little bit old, I must say. Listen-

Hillary Clinton: (01:22:16)
It’s a good one though. It well-describes the problem.

Donald Trump: (01:22:19)
No it’s not. It’s not an accurate one at all. It’s not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing, the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons. Not global warming, like you think and your president thinks. Nuclear is the single greatest threat.

Donald Trump: (01:22:43)
Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us what they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and we’re losing a fortune. That’s why we’re losing. We lose on everything. I say, who makes these? We lose on everything. All I said, that it’s very possible that if they don’t pay a fair share, because this isn’t in 40 years ago where we could do what we’re doing, we can’t defend Japan. A behemoth, selling us cars by the millions.

Moderator: (01:23:17)
We need to move on.

Donald Trump: (01:23:19)
But wait, it’s very important. All I said was they may have to defend themselves, or they have to help us out. We’re a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out. As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree, it is the single greatest threat that this country has.

Moderator: (01:23:36)
Which leads to my next question as we enter our last segment here, still on the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation’s longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.

Donald Trump: (01:23:51)
Well, I have to say that for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she’s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding, They have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night, I was seeing B52s. They’re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do for a strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over.

Donald Trump: (01:24:31)
At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can’t take anything off the table, because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we’re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I’ve ever seen negotiated, that you started, is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen, and all these other places.

Donald Trump: (01:25:13)
And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn’t you do that? Why didn’t you do add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash, nobody’s ever seen that before, that turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash. Obviously, I guess, for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.

Donald Trump: (01:25:39)
So you say to yourself, why didn’t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years and they don’t have to do much. [crosstalk 01:25:55].

Moderator: (01:25:56)
Okay, your two minutes has expired.

Donald Trump: (01:25:56)
And they’re going to end up nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he is not a happy camper.

Moderator: (01:26:02)
All right, Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (01:26:05)
Well, let me start by saying words matter, words matter when you run for president and they really matter when you are president. I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere, that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. It is essential that America’s word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I’ve talked with a number of them. But I want to on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people say that, our word is good.

Hillary Clinton: (01:26:51)
It’s also important that we look at the entire global situation. There is no doubt that we have other problems with Iran, but personally I’d rather deal with the other problems, having put that lid on their nuclear program, than still to be facing that. And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he’s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it’s like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says, it’s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.

Hillary Clinton: (01:27:38)
We need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the world follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That’s what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they’re abroad or at home. We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security, to be given any opportunities at all.

Moderator: (01:28:26)
Your two minutes has expired.

Donald Trump: (01:28:28)
Lester, on thing I’d like to say.

Moderator: (01:28:29)
Very quickly. [crosstalk 00:01:28:30].

Donald Trump: (01:28:31)
I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it get going in the first place. Right now, it’s getting tougher and tougher to defeat them because they’re in more and more places, more and more States, more and more nations-

Moderator: (01:28:48)
Mr. Trump-

Donald Trump: (01:28:48)
And it’s a big problem. As far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world-

Moderator: (01:29:06)
We have just a-

Donald Trump: (01:29:06)
Where they’re not paying us what we need.

Moderator: (01:29:08)
We have just a few final questions here.

Donald Trump: (01:29:09)
She doesn’t say that because she’s got no business ability. We need heart, we need a lot of things, but you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn’t have that. All of the things that she’s talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let’s say, while she had great power. But they weren’t taken care of, and if she ever wins this race, they won’t be taken care of.

Moderator: (01:29:29)
Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn’t have quote, “a presidential look.” She’s standing here right now. What did you mean by that?

Donald Trump: (01:29:41)
She doesn’t have the look. She doesn’t have the stamina. I said she doesn’t have the stamina. And I don’t believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country you need tremendous stamina.

Moderator: (01:29:57)
The quote was, “I just don’t think she has a presidential look.”

Donald Trump: (01:29:57)
Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question? You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate. That’s right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine we’re defending Saudi Arabia, and with all of the money they have, we’re defending them and they’re not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don’t believe that Hillary has the stamina.

Moderator: (01:30:25)
Let’s let her respond.

Hillary Clinton: (01:30:26)
Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents and opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.

Donald Trump: (01:30:49)
The world… Let me tell you, let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it’s bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last… So she’s got experience, that, I agree, but it’s bad, bad experience. Whether it’s the Iran deal, that you’re so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it’s the Iran deal, whether it’s anything you can… You almost can’t name a good deal. I agree, she’s got experience, but it’s bad experience. And this country can’t afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.

Moderator: (01:31:27)
We are at the final question.

Hillary Clinton: (01:31:30)
Well, one thing, Lester-

Moderator: (01:31:31)
Very quickly, because we’re at the final question now.

Hillary Clinton: (01:31:33)
He tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs, and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers-

Donald Trump: (01:31:48)
I never said that.

Hillary Clinton: (01:31:49)
Who has said, women don’t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men. And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman, Miss Piggy. Then he called her Miss Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.

Donald Trump: (01:32:16)
Where did you find this?

Hillary Clinton: (01:32:16)
Her name is Alicia Machado.

Donald Trump: (01:32:19)
Where did you find this?

Hillary Clinton: (01:32:19)
And she has become a US citizen, and you can bet she’s going to vote this November.

Donald Trump: (01:32:25)
Oh, really? Okay, good. Let me just tell you-

Moderator: (01:32:28)
Mr. Trump, we’re going to take 10 seconds, and then we’re going to have the final question.

Donald Trump: (01:32:30)
Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it’s said in entertainment, some of it’s said somebody who’s been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell. I said very tough things to her. And I think everybody would agree that she deserves it, and nobody feels sorry for her.

Donald Trump: (01:32:45)
But do you want to know the truth? I was going to say something-

Moderator: (01:32:49)
Please, very quick.

Donald Trump: (01:32:50)
… extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, “I can’t do it. I just can’t do it. It’s inappropriate. It’s not nice.” But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They are untrue and their misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester, it’s not nice, and I don’t deserve that, but it’s certainly not a nice thing that she’s done. It’s hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money, over $200 million-

Moderator: (01:33:28)
We have to move on.

Donald Trump: (01:33:29)
… is spent and I’m either winning or tied, and I’ve spent practically nothing.

Moderator: (01:33:33)
One of you will not win this election, so my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:33:42)
Well, I support our democracy and sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election. And I know Donald’s trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope that people out there understand, this election is really up to you. It’s not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.

Moderator: (01:34:15)
Mr. Trump, very quickly, the same question, will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?

Donald Trump: (01:34:18)
I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We’re losing our jobs, people are pouring in to our country. The other day, we were deporting 800 people, and perhaps they pass the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption. But these people that we were going to deport for good reason, ended up becoming citizens, ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800, and now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don’t even know.

Moderator: (01:34:49)
Will you accept the outcome of the election?

Donald Trump: (01:34:50)
Look, here’s the story. I want to make America great again. I’m going to be able to do it. I don’t believe Hillary will. The answer is if she wins, I will absolutely support her.

Moderator: (01:34:59)
All right, well that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening. A spirited one, we covered a lot of ground, not everything, as I suspected we wouldn’t. The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th, at Washington University in St. Louis, and October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.

Moderator: (01:35:20)
A reminder, the vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump, and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight. Goodnight, everyone.
Moderator: (00:07)
Good evening. I’m Moderator from ABC News.

Moderator: (00:11)
And I’m Moderator from CNN. We want to welcome you to Washington University in St. Louis for the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight’s debate is a town hall format, which gives voters a chance to directly ask the candidates questions. Martha and I will ask follow-up questions. But the night really belongs to the people in this room and to people across the country who have submitted questions online.

Moderator: (00:35)
The people you see on this stage were chosen by the Gallup organization. They are all from the St. Louis area and told Gallup they haven’t committed to a candidate. Each of them came here with questions they want to ask. And we saw those questions for the first time this morning. Anderson and I and our team from ABC and CNN are the only ones who have seen them.

Moderator: (00:58)
Both candidates will have two minutes to answer each audience and online question. We hope to get to as many questions as we can. So we’ve asked the audience here not to slow things down with any applause, except for now. Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:22)
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

Moderator: (01:48)
Thank you very much for being here. We’re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss. So you’ll go first. Our first question comes from Moderator. Patrice?

Moderator: (02:04)
Thank you and good evening. The last presidential debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debate as students’ homework, do you feel you’re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth?

Hillary Clinton: (02:22)
Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes. I think that’s a very good question, because I’ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we’re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity. And we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.

Hillary Clinton: (03:10)
I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That’s why the slogan of my campaign is Stronger Together. Because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another and instead we make some big goals, and I’ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable and so much else. If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there’s nothing in my opinion that America can’t do.

Hillary Clinton: (03:51)
So that’s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I’m hoping to earn your vote. I’m hoping to be elected in November. And I can promise you, I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans. Regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion, I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that’s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.

Moderator: (04:21)
Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

Donald Trump: (04:23)
Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I’ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year and a half that I’ve been doing this as a politician. I can not believe I’m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. And my whole concept was to make America great again.

Donald Trump: (04:54)
When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what’s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and healthcare is going up by numbers that are astronomical. 68%, 59%, 71%. When I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it’s a one-sided transaction where we’re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state. Really the number one terrorist state. We’ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country, just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it’s in business and trade, where we’re doing so badly.

Donald Trump: (05:39)
Last year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries, we had an $800 billion deficit. It’s hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say who’s making these deals. We’re going to make great trade deals. We’re going to have a strong border. We’re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen were shot. Two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that haven’t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great and for the Latinos, the Hispanics. And I look forward to doing it. It’s called Make America Great Again.

Moderator: (06:31)
Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about, are you both modeling positive and appropriate behaviors for today’s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday as you can imagine. You called what you said “locker room banter”. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?

Donald Trump: (06:54)
No, I didn’t say that at all. I don’t think you understood what was said. This was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly, I’m not proud of it, but this is locker room talk. When we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads and frankly drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sites all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven’t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world, and they look and they see.

Donald Trump: (07:29)
Can you imagine the people that are frankly doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what’s going on. Yes, I’m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We’re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS, and we should get onto much more important things and much bigger things.

Moderator: (08:02)
Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago, that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?

Donald Trump: (08:11)
I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.

Moderator: (08:15)
So for the record, you’re saying you never did that?

Donald Trump: (08:16)
I said things that frankly … You hear these things I’ve said and I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women and women have respect for me.

Moderator: (08:25)
Have you ever done those things?

Donald Trump: (08:28)
No, I have not. And I will tell you that I’m going to make our country safe. We’re going to have borders on our country, which we don’t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they’re coming in from the middle East and other places. We’re going to make America safe again. We’re going to make America great again, but we’re going to make America safe again, and we’re going to make America wealthy again. Because if you don’t do that, it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation. Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they’re taking our wealth-

Moderator: (08:57)
Thank you, Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (08:58)
And that’s what I want to talk about.

Moderator: (08:59)
Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?

Hillary Clinton: (09:01)
Well, like everyone else, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. With prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said, starting back in June, that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.

Hillary Clinton: (09:41)
What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn’t represent who he is, but I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it, that it represents exactly who he is because we’ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We’ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to 10. We’ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him, after the first debate, spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest most personal terms. So yes, this is who Donald Trump is.

Hillary Clinton: (10:38)
But it’s not only women and it’s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer, is that this is not who we are.

Hillary Clinton: (11:12)
That’s why to go back to your question, I want to send a message, we all should, to every boy and girl and indeed to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good and we will respect one another and we will work with one another and we will celebrate our diversity. These are very important values to me because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I’m so fortunate enough to become your president.

Moderator: (11:50)
And we want to get to some questions from online-

Donald Trump: (11:52)
Well, will I have to respond to that? I assume I am.

Moderator: (11:55)
Yes, you can respond to that.

Donald Trump: (11:58)
It’s just words, folks. It’s just words. Those words, I’ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed. I’ve heard them where Hillary’s constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, job-wise, safety-wise in every way possible.

Donald Trump: (12:26)
I’m going to help the African-Americans. I’m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help with the inner city. She’s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was a United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign-

Moderator: (12:47)
Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, I want to get to audience questions and online questions.

Donald Trump: (12:51)
So she’s allowed to do that, but I’m not allowed to respond?

Moderator: (12:54)
You’re going to get to respond right now.

Donald Trump: (12:56)
It sounds fair. It sounds fair.

Moderator: (12:57)
This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it’s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around the country via social media.

Moderator: (13:17)
And our first stays on this topic. Jeff, from Ohio, asks on Facebook, Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen? So Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.

Donald Trump: (13:40)
That was locker room talk as I’ve told you. That was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I’m not proud of it, but that was something that happened. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words and his was action. His was, what he’s done to women. There’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women.

Donald Trump: (14:10)
So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attack those same women and attack them viciously. Four of them are here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off and she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. So don’t tell me about words. Absolutely I apologize for those words, but it is things that people say.

Donald Trump: (14:53)
But what President Clinton did, he was impeached. He lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who’s also here tonight. And I will tell you that, when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it’s disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.

Moderator: (15:24)
Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (15:29)
Well first, let me start by saying that so much of what he’s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about instead of answering people’s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country. That’s his choice. When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama advised us all. When they go low, you go high.

Hillary Clinton: (16:08)
And look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he’s saying tonight would be understandable. But everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Kahn died in the line of duty in Iraq, and Donald insulted and attack them for weeks over their religion.

Hillary Clinton: (16:51)
He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana. But Donald said he couldn’t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were “Mexican”. He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television, and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology. He owes our country an apology and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.

Donald Trump: (17:34)
Well, you owe the president an apology because, as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal, he’s another real winner that you have. And he’s the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago. She was saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved. So you actually owe an apology.

Donald Trump: (18:04)
Number two, Michelle Obama. I’ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you, and I’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I’ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So you talk about friend. Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they said about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind. Because Bernie Sanders between superdelegates and Deborah Wasserman, Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.

Donald Trump: (18:50)
But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 emails that you deleted and that you acid washed. And then the two boxes of emails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And I’ll tell you what, I didn’t think I’d say this, but I’m going to say it and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it. And we’re going to have a special prosecutor.

Donald Trump: (19:37)
When I speak, I go out and speak. The people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where emails and you get a subpoena. You get a subpoena. And after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say. A very expensive process. So we’re going to get a special prosecutor and we’re going to look into it because you know what people have been … Their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you’ve done and it’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

Moderator: (20:16)
Secretary Clinton. I want to follow-up on that. I’m going to let you just talk about it [crosstalk 00:00:20:18]-

Hillary Clinton: (20:19)
-because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I’m not surprised.

Donald Trump: (20:23)
Oh really?

Moderator: (20:24)
And really, the audience needs to calm down here.

Hillary Clinton: (20:29)
In the first debate, I told people that it would be impossible to be fact checking Donald all the time. I’d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how were going to really make lives better for people.

Hillary Clinton: (20:39)
So once again, go to hillaryclinton.com. We have literally Trump. You can fact check him in real time. Last time, at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking. So I expect we’ll have millions more fact checking, because it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

Donald Trump: (21:05)
Because you’d be in jail.

Moderator: (21:06)
Secretary Clinton.

Moderator: (21:12)
We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You’re just wasting time.

Moderator: (21:19)
And Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow-up on emails. You’ve said your handling of your emails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI director James Comey calling your handling of classified information “extremely careless”. The FBI said that there were 110 classified emails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those emails. You don’t call that extremely careless?

Hillary Clinton: (21:46)
Well, Martha, first let me say, and I’ve said it before but I’ll repeat it because I want everyone to hear it, that was a mistake. And I take responsibility for using a personal email account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I’m not making any excuses. It was a mistake and I am very sorry about that.

Hillary Clinton: (22:07)
But I think it’s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using. And there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all. Anyone who says otherwise has no basis that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.

Hillary Clinton: (22:38)
I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after Bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.

Moderator: (23:09)
Okay, we’re going to move on.

Donald Trump: (23:10)
And yet, she didn’t the letter C on a document. Right? She didn’t even know what that letter meant. It’s amazing. I’m watching Hillary go over facts and she’s going after fact, after fact, and she’s lying again because she said what she did with emails was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 emails? I don’t think so. She said the 33,000 emails had to do with her daughter’s wedding, number one, and a yoga class.

Donald Trump: (23:39)
Well, maybe we’ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 emails deleted. And now she’s saying there wasn’t anything wrong. And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn’t before, that was after. She got it front of the United States Congress. And I’ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans for allowing this to happen. Our justice department, where her-

Donald Trump: (24:03)
… allowing this to happen. Our justice department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling’s got to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 emails. Again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did, and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States-

Moderator: (24:26)
We have to move on, Secretary Clinton, you can respond then we’ve got to move on.

Moderator: (24:28)
We want to give the audience a chance here.

Donald Trump: (24:31)
… in jail. Let alone, after getting a subpoena from the United States-

Moderator: (24:35)
Senator Clinton, you can respond then we have to move on to an audience question.

Hillary Clinton: (24:37)
Look, it’s just not true. Please, go to-

Donald Trump: (24:41)
Oh, you didn’t delete them?

Moderator: (24:42)
Allow her to respond, please.

Hillary Clinton: (24:42)
Those were personal emails, not official.

Donald Trump: (24:44)
Oh, 33,000? Yeah, right.

Hillary Clinton: (24:46)
Well, we turned over 35,000.

Donald Trump: (24:47)
Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?

Moderator: (24:50)
Please allow her to respond. She didn’t talk while you talked.

Hillary Clinton: (24:54)
Yes, that’s true. I didn’t.

Donald Trump: (24:55)
Because you have nothing to say.

Hillary Clinton: (24:56)
I didn’t in the first debate and I’m going to try not to in this debate because I’d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about-

Donald Trump: (25:05)
And get off this question.

Hillary Clinton: (25:09)
Okay, Donald, I know you’re into big diversion tonight. Anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But, let’s at least focus on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let’s get to their questions.

Moderator: (25:24)
We have a question here from Ken [Karpowitz 00:25:26]. He has a question about healthcare, Ken?

Donald Trump: (25:28)
I’d like to know, Anderson. Why aren’t you bringing up the emails? I’d like to know. Why aren’t you-

Moderator: (25:32)
We brought up the emails.

Donald Trump: (25:33)
No, it hasn’t. It hasn’t and it hasn’t been finished at all.

Moderator: (25:37)
Ken Karpowitz has a question.

Donald Trump: (25:38)
It’s nice, one on three.

Ken: (25:40)
Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up, deductibles have gone up, copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up and the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the costs down and make coverage better?

Moderator: (26:04)
That first one goes to Secretary Clinton because you started out the last one to the audience.

Hillary Clinton: (26:07)
He wants to start, he can start.

Donald Trump: (26:08)
Go ahead, Hillary.

Hillary Clinton: (26:09)
No, go ahead Donald.

Donald Trump: (26:10)
No, I’m a gentleman, Hillary, go ahead.

Moderator: (26:11)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (26:16)
Well, I think Donald was about to say, he’s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. I’m going to fix it because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high, copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs. I’ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here’s what I don’t want people to forget when we’re talking about reigning in the cost, which has to be the highest priority of the next president. When the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn’t just that 20 million people got insurance who didn’t have it before. But, that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits.

Hillary Clinton: (27:09)
Number one, insurance companies can’t deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can’t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you’re under 26 and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26. Something that didn’t happen before.

Hillary Clinton: (27:40)
So, I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act, but we’ve got to get costs down. We’ve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. Then we would have to start all over again. Right now we are at 90% health insurance coverage, that’s the highest we’ve ever been in our country.

Moderator: (28:17)
Secretary Clinton, your time is up.

Hillary Clinton: (28:18)
I want us to get to 100%, but get costs down and keep quality up.

Moderator: (28:23)
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

Donald Trump: (28:25)
It is such a great question. It’s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it, we all know it. It’s going up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen worldwide. Nobody’s ever seen numbers like this for healthcare. It’s only getting worse. In ’17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have, right now, almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It’s very bad, very bad health insurance, far too expensive. Not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It’s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.

Donald Trump: (29:14)
We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing because they wanted, President Obama and whoever was working on it, they want to leave those lines because that gives the insurance companies, essentially, monopolies. We want competition.

Donald Trump: (29:43)
You will have the finest healthcare plan there is. She wants to go to a single payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. Have you ever noticed that Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It’s catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. Not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody has ever believed, but your deductibles are going up so that, unless you get hit by a truck, you’re never going to be able to use it. It is a disastrous plan and it has to be repealed and replaced.

Moderator: (30:34)
Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare quote, “the craziest thing in the world” saying that small business owners are getting killed, premiums doubled, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was his mistake simply telling the truth?

Hillary Clinton: (30:47)
No. I mean, he clarified what he meant and it’s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system, but we have an employer-based system. That’s where the vast majority of people get their healthcare. The Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn’t put together any resources to afford healthcare, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously Medicare, which is a single payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it by the way. Then all the people who were employed, people who were working but didn’t have the money to afford insurance and didn’t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.

Hillary Clinton: (31:40)
Like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. If we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald’s not telling you is, we just turn it back to the insurance companies, the way it used to be. That means the insurance companies get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, “Look, I’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes. You had cancer. Your child has asthma-”

Moderator: (32:01)
Your time is up.

Hillary Clinton: (32:01)
” … you may not be able to have insurance because you can’t afford it.” Let’s fix what’s broken about it, but let’s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies [crosstalk 00:32:12] that’s not going to work.

Moderator: (32:12)
Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this one.

Donald Trump: (32:15)
Just one thing. First of all, Hillary, every thing is broken about it, everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.

Moderator: (32:28)
Mr. Trump, you’ve said, you want to end Obamacare. You’ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you’re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?

Donald Trump: (32:39)
We’re going to be able to. You’re going to have plans-

Moderator: (32:41)
What does that mean?

Donald Trump: (32:42)
I’ll tell you what it means. You’re going to have plans that are so good because we’re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come. President Obama-

Moderator: (32:54)
Are you going to mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?

Donald Trump: (32:57)
Excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state. It was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which by the way, was a fraud. You know that because Jonathan Grouper, the architect of Obamacare, he said it was a great lie. It was a big lie. President Obama said, “You keep your doctor. You keep your plan.” The whole thing was a fraud and it doesn’t work.

Donald Trump: (33:22)
But, when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition and we will be able to keep pre-existing. We’ll also be able to help people that don’t have money because we are going to have people protected and Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We’re going to block grant into the states. We’re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.

Moderator: (33:49)
Thank you, Mr. Trump.

Moderator: (33:50)
We now go to Gorba Hameed with a question for both candidates.

Gorba: (33:55)
Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States and I’m one of them. You’ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?

Moderator: (34:13)
Mr. Trump, you’re first.

Donald Trump: (34:15)
Well, you’re right about Islamophobia and that’s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that … Because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we can be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. We have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded, many, many people. Horribly wounded, they’ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.

Donald Trump: (34:58)
There’s always a reason for everything. If they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside, look at Paris, look at that horrible … These are radical Islamic terrorists. She won’t even mention the word. Nor will president Obama, he won’t use the term radical Islamic terrorism.

Donald Trump: (35:24)
Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is, or at least say the name. She won’t say the name and President Obama won’t say the name, but the name is there. It’s radical Islamic terror. Before you solve it, you have to say the name.

Moderator: (35:43)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (35:45)
Thank you for asking your question. I’ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim Americans across our country because, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. Even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. I want to say just a couple of things. First, we’ve had Muslims in America since George Washington and we’ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particularly well-known one with Muhammad Ali. My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place. If you’re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That’s what America is. That’s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.

Hillary Clinton: (36:46)
It’s also very shortsighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I’ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I’ve met with a lot of them and I’ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security. That’s what I want to see.

Hillary Clinton: (37:17)
It’s also important, I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, ” Why should we cooperate with the Americans?” This is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam and it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.

Moderator: (37:55)
Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump, in December, you said this, “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.” Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct and, if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?

Donald Trump: (38:23)
First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero. If I were president at that time he would be alive today because, unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster. So, he would have been alive today. The Muslim ban is something that, in some form, has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow-

Moderator: (38:57)
Why did it morph into that? No. Did you, no, answer the question. Do you still believe [crosstalk 00:39:02] I do.

Donald Trump: (39:01)
You interrupt me all the time. Why don’t you interrupt her?

Moderator: (39:04)
Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands.

Donald Trump: (39:09)
It’s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria, where they’re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550% increase over Obama. People are coming into our country, we have no idea who they are, where they’re from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550% more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country.

Donald Trump: (39:44)
I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them. As an example, the Gulf states who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them, we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.

Moderator: (40:11)
Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting, that’s not a perfect system. Why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?

Hillary Clinton: (40:28)
First of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children. Think of that picture we all saw of that four year old boy with the blood on his forehead because he’d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely I believe because of Russian aggression. We need to do our part. We, by no means, are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts, and others.

Hillary Clinton: (41:17)
But it is important for us as a policy not to say, as Donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own country? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country and how do we expect to be able to implement those?

Hillary Clinton: (41:52)
I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. Indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters because they want to create a war between us. The final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he’s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It’s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.

Donald Trump: (42:39)
Has not been debunked.

Hillary Clinton: (42:40)
So, please, go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.

Donald Trump: (42:40)
I was against the war in Iraq. It has not been debunked and you voted for it and you shouldn’t have.

Moderator: (42:42)
There’s been lots of fact checking on that. I’d like to move on to an online question.

Donald Trump: (42:46)
Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.

Moderator: (42:50)
She did not.

Donald Trump: (42:50)
Could I just respond to this, please?

Moderator: (42:51)
Very quickly, please.

Donald Trump: (42:53)
Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says, “We don’t want them.” In some cases, they’re murderers, drug lords, drug problems, and they don’t want them. Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State said, “That’s okay, we can’t force it into their country.” Let me tell you, I’m going to force them right back into their country. They’re murderers and some very bad people. I will tell you very strongly when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you’ve never seen. We’re also letting drugs pour through our Southern border at a record clip, at a record clip, it shouldn’t be allowed to happen. ICE just endorsed me. They’ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The border patrol agents, 16,500 just recently endorsed me and they endorse me because I understand the border. She doesn’t, she wants amnesty for everybody, come right in, come right over. It’s a horrible thing she’s doing. She’s got bad judgment and honestly so bad that she should never be President of the United States. That I can tell you.

Moderator: (44:06)
Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question comes from the public through the bi-partisan open debate coalitions online forum where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton’s paid speeches which she has refused to release.

Moderator: (44:27)
One line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say “You need both a public and private position on certain issues.” So, Tu from Virginia asks, is it okay for politicians to be too faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (44:51)
Right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called Lincoln. It was a masterclass watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled and it was strategic. I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. Yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people he used other arguments. That was a great, I thought, a great display of presidential leadership.

Hillary Clinton: (45:43)
Let’s talk about what’s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts, to influence our election. WikiLeaks is part of that as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don’t even know if it’s accurate information, and then they put it out.

Hillary Clinton: (46:16)
We have never, in the history of our country, been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. Believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. They’re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow. I don’t know the reasons, but we deserve answers and we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relations-

Moderator: (46:58)
We’re going to get to that later-

Hillary Clinton: (46:59)
… that he has with Russians and other foreign powers.

Moderator: (47:00)
Secretary Clinton, you’re out of time.

Donald Trump: (47:02)
Well, I think I should respond because … So ridiculous. Look, now she’s blaming … She got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else. She said things, WikiLeaks that just came out, and she lied. Now, she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That’s one that I haven’t heard. Okay. Honest Abe never lied. That’s the good thing. That’s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That’s a big, big difference. We’re talking about some difference.

Donald Trump: (47:37)
But, as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don’t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together as an example. But I don’t know Putin. But I noticed anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians … She doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking, but they always blame Russia. The reason they blame Russia is because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia.

Donald Trump: (48:03)
And the reason they blame Russia, because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don’t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.

Donald Trump: (48:35)
But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have … First of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who’s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me took massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes, but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I’ll release my returns. I’ll be very proud to. They’re actually quite great.

Moderator: (49:18)
Thank you, Mr. Trump.

Moderator: (49:19)
We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?

Spencer Maass: (49:28)
Good evening. My question is what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?

Moderator: (49:36)
Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.

Donald Trump: (49:38)
Well, one thing I’d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn’t she change it? Why didn’t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn’t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do, and I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn’t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.

Donald Trump: (50:16)
And I say that about a lot of things. I’ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. “I wish you would have done this.” But she’s been there for 30 years she’s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We’re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I’m lowering taxes actually, because I think it’s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving, massive corporations and little ones, little ones can’t form. We’re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we’re bringing the tax rate down from 35% to 15%. We’re cutting taxes for the middle class, and I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.

Donald Trump: (50:54)
And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She’s raising your taxes really high, and what that’s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I’m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There’s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7%, it’s like a national catastrophe. We’re down at 1%, and that’s like no growth. And we’re going lower, in my opinion, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I’m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it’s so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody’s taxes massively.

Moderator: (51:43)
Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?

Hillary Clinton: (51:51)
Well, everything you’ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I’m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality, and it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn’t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he’s going to do, but I’ll tell you what he’s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.

Hillary Clinton: (52:36)
Now, here’s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year, and that’s the vast majority of Americans as you know, will have their taxes raised, because I think we’ve got to go where the money is, and the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It’s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who’s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.

Hillary Clinton: (53:25)
We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard- working families. And I think it’s been unfortunate, but it’s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.

Moderator: (53:52)
Thank you, Secretary.

Hillary Clinton: (53:52)
And we’re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.

Moderator: (54:01)
Thank you. I want to give you … Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she’s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You’ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?

Hillary Clinton: (54:32)
Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.

Moderator: (54:39)
So have you [inaudible 00:54:40] personal federal income tax?

Hillary Clinton: (54:40)
A lot of my … Excuse me, Anderson. A lot of my write-off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she’ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That’s why. See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that’s ever run for president, and it’s extremely complex. Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people, but they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary’s leaving. Very interesting why she’s leaving carried interest. But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it, and so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won’t mention their names, because they’re rich, but they’re not famous, so we won’t make them famous.

Moderator: (55:33)
Can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?

Hillary Clinton: (55:38)
No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it’s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. She’s given it to us. Hey, if she had a problem, for 30 years she’s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn’t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn’t she do something about it? She doesn’t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it’s all talk and no action.

Moderator: (56:04)
In the past-

Hillary Clinton: (56:05)
And again, Bernie Sanders, it’s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She’s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they’ve left, that’s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they’re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.

Moderator: (56:33)
I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (56:38)
Well, here we go again. I’ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that’s not the point here.

Donald Trump: (56:48)
Why didn’t you do it? Why didn’t you do it?

Moderator: (56:49)
Allow her to respond.

Hillary Clinton: (56:49)
Because I was a senator with a Republican president.

Donald Trump: (56:51)
Oh, really?

Hillary Clinton: (56:52)
I will be the president and we will get it done. That’s exactly right.

Donald Trump: (56:56)
You could have done it, if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it, but you were not an effective senator.

Moderator: (57:02)
Please allow her to respond. She didn’t interrupt you.

Hillary Clinton: (57:04)
Under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, “30 years this and 30 years that,” so let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I’m very glad to do so. Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was First Lady, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.

Hillary Clinton: (58:06)
When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women’s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. 400 pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time, and as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.

Moderator: (58:52)
Thank you, Secretary.

Hillary Clinton: (58:52)
I’ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I’ve produced results for people.

Moderator: (58:56)
Thank you, secretary.

Moderator: (58:58)
We’re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.

Donald Trump: (59:01)
She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe …

Moderator: (59:04)
No, Mr. Trump, we’re going to go on. This is about the audience.

Donald Trump: (59:06)
Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.

Moderator: (59:08)
Mr. Trump, we’re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world’s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone. But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo. So this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, “If you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn’t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?” Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (01:00:11)
Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic, and every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left, and there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.

Hillary Clinton: (01:00:52)
Russia hasn’t paid any attention to ISIS. They’re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was Secretary of State, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them, and we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it’s all in in Syria, and they’ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it’s not me. I’ve stood up to Russia. I’ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.

Hillary Clinton: (01:01:50)
I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that’s fine, and I did as secretary of state. That’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It’s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.

Moderator: (01:02:19)
Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?

Donald Trump: (01:02:20)
First of all, she was there as Secretary of State with the so-called line in the sand, which-

Hillary Clinton: (01:02:25)
No, I wasn’t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point-

Donald Trump: (01:02:28)
Okay, but you were in contact … Excuse me. You were-

Hillary Clinton: (01:02:30)
At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.

Donald Trump: (01:02:30)
You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don’t think he would be listening to you very much anymore. Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened. Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia, but our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they’ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn’t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We’re tired. We’re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.

Donald Trump: (01:03:08)
Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn’t even know who the rebels are. Every time we take rebels, whether it’s in Iraq or anywhere else, we’re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi’s out. It’s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I’m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she’s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it’s been a disaster.

Donald Trump: (01:03:46)
But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn’t there, but possibly she’s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone’s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I’ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room. But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us, so she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There’s only one problem. You don’t even know who the rebels are. So what’s the purpose?

Moderator: (01:04:25)
Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.

Donald Trump: (01:04:27)
And one thing I have to say.

Moderator: (01:04:28)
Your two minutes is up.

Donald Trump: (01:04:29)
I don’t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS and Iran is killing ISIS, and those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.

Moderator: (01:04:42)
Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength, and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.

Donald Trump: (01:05:14)
Okay. He and I haven’t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.

Moderator: (01:05:18)
You disagree with your running mate?

Donald Trump: (01:05:19)
I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time, but Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it’s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly. Very, very quickly. I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn’t.

Moderator: (01:05:51)
What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?

Donald Trump: (01:05:53)
I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.

Moderator: (01:05:56)
What do you think will happen if it falls?

Donald Trump: (01:05:59)
I think that it basically has fallen, okay? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul, so we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, “We will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.” Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can’t they do it quietly? Why can’t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we’ve knocked out the leaders, we’ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we’re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they’re saying? How stupid is our country?

Moderator: (01:06:44)
There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.

Donald Trump: (01:06:48)
I can’t think of any. I can’t think of any. And I’m pretty good at it.

Moderator: (01:06:51)
It might be to help get civilians out.

Donald Trump: (01:06:51)
And we have General Flynn. Look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can’t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? Why would these people stay there? I’ve been reading now for weeks.

Moderator: (01:07:16)
Tell me what your strategy is.

Donald Trump: (01:07:17)
I’ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it’s the harbor of where … between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be staying? They’re not staying there anymore. They’re gone, because everybody’s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul. Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can’t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we’re doing in the Middle East.

Moderator: (01:07:50)
I’m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?

Hillary Clinton: (01:08:12)
I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don’t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don’t think that is a smart strategy. I do think the use of special forces, which we’re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just …

Moderator: (01:08:47)
But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?

Hillary Clinton: (01:08:49)
Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I, if I’m fortunate-

Moderator: (01:08:52)
Everything.

Hillary Clinton: (01:08:53)
I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn’t. There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this, and that takes a lot of planning and preparation. I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al-Qaeda leaders, and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones, made a difference. So I think that could help.

Hillary Clinton: (01:09:42)
I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there’s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.

Moderator: (01:10:06)
Thank you very much. We’re going to move on.

Donald Trump: (01:10:07)
You know what’s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don’t stop her. When I go one second over, it’s like a big deal.

Moderator: (01:10:13)
You had many answers.

Donald Trump: (01:10:14)
It’s really very interesting.

Moderator: (01:10:15)
We’ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?

James Carter: (01:10:24)
My question is do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?

Moderator: (01:10:39)
That question begins for Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (01:10:41)
Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people, and I’ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back, because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she’s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn’t say it. They actually said that she lied, okay? And she lied. But she’s lied about a lot of things.

Donald Trump: (01:11:35)
I would be a president for all of the people, African-Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what’s happening to our inner cities. She’s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn’t get it done. Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don’t get it done. You go into the inner cities, and you see it’s 45% poverty. African-Americans now …

Donald Trump: (01:12:03)
The inner cities and you see it’s 45% poverty African Americans now 45% poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially non-existent. I’ve been saying big speeches where I have 20 and 30,000 people. What do you have to lose? It can’t get any worse. She’s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing’s going to ever happen.

Donald Trump: (01:12:29)
Let me tell you. If she’s president of the United States, nothing’s going to happen. It’s just going to be talk and all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She’s not doing any me favors, but by doing all the other’s favors, she’s doing me favors.

Moderator: (01:12:43)
Mr. Trump, thank you.

Donald Trump: (01:12:44)
But I will tell you she’s all talk. It doesn’t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.

Moderator: (01:12:51)
Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton.

Donald Trump: (01:12:52)
It turned out to be a disaster.

Moderator: (01:12:54)
You have two minutes, secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:12:55)
Well, 67% of the people voted to reelect me when I ran for my second term and I was very proud and very humbled by that. Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. Right out of law school, I went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund and Donald talks a lot about the 30 years I’ve been in public service. I’m proud of that.

Hillary Clinton: (01:13:27)
I started off as a young lawyer, working against discrimination against African American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education. Something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos. One of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas, registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion to use your absolutely correct word. To making sure that every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.

Hillary Clinton: (01:14:06)
I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn’t have a place in Donald Trump’s America. They write me and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He’s 10 years old now. This is the only country he’s ever known. He listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, ” Will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?”

Hillary Clinton: (01:14:35)
Children listen to what is being said to go back to the very, very first question. There’s a lot of fear that in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns. So first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.

Moderator: (01:14:59)
Your time. Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:15:00)
Democrats, independents, people across our country. If you don’t vote for me, I’m still want to be your president.

Moderator: (01:15:04)
Your two minutes is up.

Hillary Clinton: (01:15:05)
I want to be the best president I can be for every American.

Moderator: (01:15:07)
Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you. A comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump’s supporters are “deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.” You later said you regretted saying half. You didn’t express regret for using the term deplorables. To Mr. Carter’s question, how can you unite a country if you’ve written off tens of millions of Americans?

Hillary Clinton: (01:15:30)
Well, within hours, I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that because my argument is not with his supporters. It’s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run and the inciting of violence at his rallies and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans. All kinds of Americans. What he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities he’s never apologized for.

Hillary Clinton: (01:16:09)
So I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said, I’m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. He is supporting me a hundred percent because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might’ve had some differences and we had a lot of debates-

Moderator: (01:16:28)
Thank you, Secretary.

Hillary Clinton: (01:16:28)
But we believed that we could make the country better and I was proud of that.

Moderator: (01:16:32)
[inaudible 01:16:32].

Donald Trump: (01:16:33)
We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte, you look at Baltimore, you look at the violence that’s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington DC. We have a increase in murder within our cities. The biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation because people like her and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.

Donald Trump: (01:17:01)
When she said deplorables, she meant it. When she said irredeemable, they’re irredeemable, you didn’t mention that. But when she said they’re irredeemable, to me that might’ve been even worse.

Moderator: (01:17:13)
She said some of them are-

Donald Trump: (01:17:16)
She’s got tremendous hatred and this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama and that’s what you’re getting with her.

Moderator: (01:17:24)
Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said if a leader doesn’t have it, “He or she won’t be one for very long.” In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM, including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader-

Donald Trump: (01:17:43)
No, there wasn’t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful girl scout, who was no girl scout. By the way, just so you understand. When she said 3:00 in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said, “Who’s going to answer the call at 3:00 in the morning?” Guess what? She didn’t answer. Because when ambassador Stevens-

Moderator: (01:18:03)
The question is is that the discipline of a good leader?

Donald Trump: (01:18:05)
600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3:00 in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3:00 in the morning, but I won’t even mention that. But she said, “She’ll be awake.” Who’s [inaudible 01:18:14] the famous thing. We’re going to answer our call at 3:00 in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help and the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal who’s her friend and not a good guy, by the way.

Donald Trump: (01:18:31)
So she shouldn’t be talking about that. Now tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you could like it or not like it. I have between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It’s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I’m not unproud of it, to be honest with you.

Moderator: (01:18:52)
Secretary Clinton does Mr. Trump had the discipline to be a good leader?

Hillary Clinton: (01:18:56)
No.

Donald Trump: (01:18:57)
I’m shocked to hear that.

Hillary Clinton: (01:18:59)
Well, it’s not only my opinion. It’s the opinion of many others. National Security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress, but it’s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it’s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus and 23 million new jobs were created and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33% and it’s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11.

Hillary Clinton: (01:19:45)
I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said, “You’ve got it,” and he never wavered. He stuck with me and I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since The Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.

Moderator: (01:20:28)
Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much. Both of you. We have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.

Beth Miller: (01:20:43)
Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is a Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?

Moderator: (01:20:55)
We begin with your two minutes, secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:20:57)
Thank you. Well, you’re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerk for a judge and then gotten on the bench. But maybe they tried some more cases. They actually understand what people are up against because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. So I would want to see the Supreme court reverse Citizens United and get dark unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn’t agree with that.

Hillary Clinton: (01:21:38)
I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country. That we don’t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe V. Wade and a woman’s right to choose and I want a Supreme court that will stick with marriage equality.

Hillary Clinton: (01:22:04)
Now Donald has put forward the names of some people that he would consider and among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe V. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you’re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.

Hillary Clinton: (01:22:32)
So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they’ve not given him a vote to be able to have the full compliment of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices-

Moderator: (01:23:10)
Thank you Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (01:23:11)
[crosstalk 01:23:11] work on behalf of our people.

Moderator: (01:23:12)
Thank you, you’re out of time. Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (01:23:14)
Justice Scalia, great judge died recently and we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I’m looking for judges and I’ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody, but people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. I think that this so important. Also the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.

Donald Trump: (01:23:59)
They’ll respect the second amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me. Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions, just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than a $100 million put in of my money, meaning I’m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations, like she’s doing. What I ask is this.

Donald Trump: (01:24:20)
So I’m putting in more than, by the time it’s finished, I’ll have more than $100 million dollars invested. Pretty much self-funding mine. We’re raising money for the Republican party and we’re doing tremendously on the small donation, $61 average or so. I ask Hillary why doesn’t she made $250 million by being in office? She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn’t she funding, not for a hundred million, but why don’t you put 10 or 20 or 25 or $30 million into your own campaign?

Donald Trump: (01:24:51)
It’s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren’t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You’ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you’ve been in office. You made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren’t you putting money into your own campaign? Just curious.

Moderator: (01:25:14)
Thank you very much. We’re going to get onto one more question.

Hillary Clinton: (01:25:17)
The question was about the Supreme Court and I just want to quickly say-

Moderator: (01:25:19)
Very quickly.

Hillary Clinton: (01:25:20)
I respect the Second Amendment, but I believe there should be comprehensive background checks and we should close the gun show loophole and close the online loophole.

Moderator: (01:25:29)
We have one more question [crosstalk 01:25:32].

Hillary Clinton: (01:25:32)
[crosstalk 01:25:32] as we possibly can.

Moderator: (01:25:33)
We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?

Ken Bone: (01:25:40)
What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?

Moderator: (01:25:51)
Mr. Trump, two minutes.

Donald Trump: (01:25:52)
Absolutely. I think it’s such a great question because energy is under siege by the Obama administration, under absolute siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency is killing these energy companies and foreign companies are now coming in buying so many of our different plants and then rejiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil. We are killing, absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now I’m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera, but we need much more than wind and solar.

Donald Trump: (01:26:29)
You look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for a thousand years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable, we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under feat.

Donald Trump: (01:26:51)
So good. Especially when you have 20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. There’ll be able to compete. They’ll make money. They’ll pay off our national debt. They’ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous, but we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what’s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.

Donald Trump: (01:27:28)
We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. All you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they’re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It’s a disgrace.

Moderator: (01:27:54)
Your time is up, thank you [crosstalk 01:27:55].

Donald Trump: (01:27:55)
It’s an absolute disgrace.

Moderator: (01:27:56)
Secretary Clinton, two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (01:27:59)
Well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings. Putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That’s something that I fought against as a Senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don’t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else. You know, because it sounds like you’re in the business or you’re aware of people in the business, you know, that we are now for the first time ever energy independent.

Hillary Clinton: (01:28:36)
We are not dependent upon the middle East, but the middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down and that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are however producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. I think that’s an important transition. We’ve got to remain energy independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the middle East.

Hillary Clinton: (01:29:08)
We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change because I think that is a serious problem. I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind.

Hillary Clinton: (01:29:38)
That’s why I’m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories. I don’t want to walk away from them. So we’ve got to do something for them, but the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively and that’s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to Hillaryclinton.com-

Moderator: (01:30:10)

Hillary Clinton: (01:30:11)
[crosstalk 01:30:11] my entire policy.

Moderator: (01:30:13)
One more audience question.

Moderator: (01:30:13)
We’ve sneaked in one more question and it comes from Carl Becker.

Carl Becker: (01:30:22)
Good evening. My question to both of you is regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one or another?

Moderator: (01:30:42)
Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?

Hillary Clinton: (01:30:47)
Well, I certainly will because I think that’s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted. I think that says a lot about Donald. I don’t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me. So I believe that this election has become in part so conflict oriented, so intense because there’s a lot at stake.

Hillary Clinton: (01:31:33)
This is not an ordinary time and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else.

Hillary Clinton: (01:31:54)
So there is a lot at stake. It’s one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had. And that’s why I’ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. That’s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that yes, I’ve spent 30 years actually, maybe a little more working to help kids and families and I want to take all that experience to the white house and do that every single day.

Moderator: (01:32:26)
Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (01:32:28)
Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don’t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great … I’m very proud of my children and they’ve done a wonderful job and they’ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment. I will say this about Hillary. She doesn’t quit. She doesn’t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She’s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she’s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases, but she does fight hard and she doesn’t quit and she doesn’t give up. I consider that to be a very good trait.

Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University Of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.
Moderator: (00:08)
Good evening from the Thomas & Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I’m Moderator of Fox News. And I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format, six, roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump,

Moderator: (01:28)
Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let’s get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court. You both talked briefly about the Court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments, which means that you will in effect determine the balance of the Court for what could be the next quarter-century. First of all, where do you want to see the Court take the country? And secondly, what’s your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the Founders’ words mean what they say, or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (02:18)
Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us. I think when we talk about the Supreme Court it really raises the central issue in this election. Namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have? And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.

Hillary Clinton: (03:19)
I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country’s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United. We stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say the Supreme Court should represent all of us. That’s how I see the Court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the Court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans. And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That’s the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates and then the Senate advises and consents or not, but they go forward with the process.

Moderator: (04:26)
Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the Court take the country on how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?

Donald Trump: (04:36)
Well, first of all, it’s great to be with you and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court, it’s what it’s all about our country is so … It’s just so imperative that we have the right justices. Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent, and she was forced to apologize and apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion, is going to uphold the Second Amendment and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don’t think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment, which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it’s absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma.

Donald Trump: (05:38)
I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint and I’ve named 20 of them, the justices that I’m going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars, in all cases, and are people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the Founders wanted it interpreted and I believe that’s very, very important. I don’t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It’s all about the Constitution of … And so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.

Moderator: (06:28)
Mr. Trump, thank you. We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned Mr. Trump, and that is guns. Secretary Clinton, you said last year, and let me quote, “The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.” And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the Court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the judge, Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What’s wrong with that?

Hillary Clinton: (07:08)
Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country. But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn’t mean that I want people who shouldn’t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family. And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.

Hillary Clinton: (07:52)
There’s other matters that I think are sensible, that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment. You mentioned the Heller decision, and what I was saying that you referenced Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the Court applied the Second Amendment in that case because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns. And so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the Court didn’t accept that reasonable regulation, but they’ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people’s lives and defending the Second Amendment.

Moderator: (08:35)
Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here and this was in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton’s answer. Does she persuade you that while you may disagree on regulation, that in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?

Donald Trump: (09:00)
Well, the DC versus Heller decision was very strongly and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved and it was a well-crafted decision, but Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry, and people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.

Moderator: (09:25)
Let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?

Hillary Clinton: (09:28)
Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes take appropriate precautions. But there’s no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there’s an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible common-sense regulation. And look, I understand that Donald’s been strongly supported by the NRA, the gun lobby is on his side, they’re running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say, “Of course, we’re going to protect and defend the Second Amendment, but we’re going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.”

Let me bring Mr. Trump back into that because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high capacity magazines, you support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?

Donald Trump: (10:37)
Well, let me just tell you before we go any further, in Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence. I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am, I don’t know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I’m very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA and it’s the earliest endorsement they’ve ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I’m very honored by all of that. We are going to appoint justices, this is the best way to help the Second Amendment, we are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.

Moderator: (11:23)
Well, let’s pick up on another issue which divides you, and the justices, whoever ends up winning this election of points, could have a dramatic effect there, and that’s the issue of abortion.

Donald Trump: (11:36)
Right.

Moderator: (11:36)
Mr. Trump, you’re pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically, do you want the Court, including the justices that you will name to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes in fact, states a woman’s right to abortion?

Donald Trump: (11:50)
Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.

Moderator: (11:58)
But I’m asking you specifically, would you like the-

Donald Trump: (12:00)
If they overturned it, it’ll go back to the states.

Moderator: (12:02)
But what I’m asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the Court overturn? You just said you want to see the Court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the Court overturn Roe v. Wade?

Donald Trump: (12:11)
Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that will happen, and that’ll happen automatically in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the Court. I will say this, it will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination.

Moderator: (12:29)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (12:30)
Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult in many cases, decisions about her healthcare that one can imagine. And in this case, it’s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what’s happening right now in America. So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country. Donald has said he’s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood, even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade. And I will defend women’s rights to make their own healthcare decisions.

Moderator: (13:27)
Secretary Clinton-

Hillary Clinton: (13:27)
We have come too far to have that turned back now. And indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions, and I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thing.

Moderator: (13:43)
I’m going to give you a chance to respond. But I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term partial-birth abortions. Why?

Hillary Clinton: (14:03)
Because Roe V Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a Senator, I did not think that that was the case. The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.

Moderator: (15:03)
Mr. Trump, your reaction, and particularly on this issue of late-term partial-birth abortion.

Donald Trump: (15:07)
Well, I think it’s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that’s okay. And Hillary can say that that’s okay, but it’s not okay with me because based on what she’s saying and based on where she’s going and where she’s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day. And that’s not acceptable.

Hillary Clinton: (15:40)
Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I’ve met with, women I’ve known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it. I’ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I’ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in China or forced women to bear children like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you, the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.

Moderator: (16:29)
All right. Just briefly, I want to move on to another segment.

Donald Trump: (16:32)
And honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth, nobody has that.

Moderator: (16:42)
All right. Let’s move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you. Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first hundred days as president, you’re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question really is why are you right and your opponent wrong? Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment, you have two minutes.

Donald Trump: (17:19)
Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that waiting in line for many, many years. We need strong borders. In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of, I mean, these are unbelievable people that I’ve gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They’re coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border secure …

Donald Trump: (17:56)
As you know, the border patrol agents, 16,500 plus ICE last week endorsed me. First time they’ve ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher, but they know what’s going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders. I was up in New Hampshire the other day, the biggest complaint they have, it’s with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama, all of the problems, their single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern borders, just pouring and destroying their youth. It’s poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.

Donald Trump: (18:34)
We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. Right now, we’re getting the drugs, they’re getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute. We cannot give amnesty. Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall and the border patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones. We have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We’re going to get them out. We’re going to secure the border. And once the border is secured at a later date, we’ll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out.

Moderator: (19:16)
Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton, basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?

Hillary Clinton: (19:23)
Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who was very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country, but they were not. They work hard. They do everything they can to give her a good life. And you’re right, I don’t want to rip families apart. I don’t want to be sending parents away from children. I don’t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix, that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.

Hillary Clinton: (20:09)
Now here’s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home, to home, business, to business, rounding up people who are undocumented, and we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country. I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it’s an idea that would rip our country apart. I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate, and my comprehensive immigration reform plan, of course, includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they’re most needed. Getting rid of any violent person, anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.

Hillary Clinton: (21:02)
When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president, didn’t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said, “We’re not paying for that wall.” So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that’s why I’m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first hundred days with a path to citizenship.

Moderator: (21:29)
Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up-

Donald Trump: (21:31)
Chris, I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico, a very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals, believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind signed by anybody. It’s a disaster. Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now she never gets anything done, so naturally, the wall wasn’t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.

Moderator: (22:05)
Well, let me … Wait, wait, wait. Sir, let me-

Donald Trump: (22:07)
We are a country of laws. We either have … And by the way-

Moderator: (22:09)
No, wait a minute.

Donald Trump: (22:09)
Well, but she said one thing.

Moderator: (22:09)
I’d like to hear from Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (22:14)
I voted for border security and there are-

Donald Trump: (22:17)
And the wall.

Hillary Clinton: (22:18)
There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that. But it is clear when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants, rapists, and criminals, and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good because then employers can’t exploit them and undercut Americans’ wages. And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do, “You complain, I’ll get you deported.” I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts. American workers.

Moderator: (23:21)
Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (23:22)
President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it. Nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They’ve been deported. She doesn’t want to say that, but that’s what’s happened and that’s what’s happened, big league. As far as moving these people out and moving, we either have a country or we don’t. We’re a country of laws. We either have a border or we don’t. Now you can come back in and you can become a citizen but it’s very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They’re online. They’re waiting. We’re going to speed up the process big league because it’s very inefficient. But they’re online and they’re waiting to become citizens. Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen. Under her plan, you have open-

Donald Trump: (24:03)
Somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen. Under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade and you will have a disaster with your open borders.

Hillary Clinton: (24:09)
We will-

Donald Trump: (24:10)
But what she doesn’t say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.

Moderator: (24:16)
Secretary Clinton, [inaudible 00:00:18].

Hillary Clinton: (24:17)
We will not have open borders.

Moderator: (24:19)
Well, let me ask, Secretary-

Hillary Clinton: (24:20)
That is a rank mischaracterization.

Moderator: (24:22)
Secretary Clinton-

Hillary Clinton: (24:23)
We will have secure borders, but we will also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the president to sign immigration reform and George W. Bush supported it as well.

Moderator: (24:35)
Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank for which you were paid $225,000, we’ve learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, “My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.” So that’s the question. That’s the question. Please, quiet everybody. Is that your dream, open borders?

Hillary Clinton: (25:02)
Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. We trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that will be a great benefit to us, but you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what’s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet.

Hillary Clinton: (25:50)
This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly from Putin himself, in an effort as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We’ve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.

Donald Trump: (26:32)
That was a great pivot off the fact that you want open borders. Okay. How did we get off to Putin?

Hillary Clinton: (26:39)
Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait. Hold on folks. Because this is going to end up getting out of control. Let’s try to keep it quiet. So for the candidates and for the American people. Go ahead.

Donald Trump: (26:48)
So just to finish on the borders, she wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550% more people than Barack Obama. And he has thousands and thousands of people that have no idea where they come from. And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won’t even mention the words and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders. Now, we can talk about Putin. I don’t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good if Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I’ll tell you what, we’re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads, 1800, by the way, where they expanded and we didn’t. 1800 nuclear warheads and she’s playing chicken. Look, Putin, from everything I see, has no respect for this person.

Hillary Clinton: (27:56)
Well, that’s because he’d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.

Donald Trump: (27:59)
No puppet. No puppet.

Hillary Clinton: (28:01)
It’s pretty clear. It’s pretty clear. You won’t admit-

Donald Trump: (28:04)
No, you’re the puppet.

Hillary Clinton: (28:04)
… that the Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wishlist, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race. So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We’ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17, 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyber attacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin. And they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing. And I think it’s time-

Moderator: (29:01)
Secretary Clinton-

Donald Trump: (29:03)
She has no idea whether it’s Russia-

Hillary Clinton: (29:03)
… you take a stand because-

Donald Trump: (29:03)
… or China or anybody else.

Hillary Clinton: (29:05)
I am not quoting myself.

Donald Trump: (29:06)
She has no idea. Hillary, you have no idea.

Hillary Clinton: (29:06)
I am quoting 17. 17. Do you doubt?

Donald Trump: (29:10)
And our country has no idea.

Hillary Clinton: (29:14)
17 military and civilian agencies.

Donald Trump: (29:15)
Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.

Hillary Clinton: (29:16)
He’d rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just fascinating.

Donald Trump: (29:25)
She doesn’t like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.

Moderator: (29:30)
Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (29:32)
Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria. He’s outsmarted her every step of the way.

Moderator: (29:37)
Mr. Trump, I am not a potted plant here. I do get to ask some questions.

Donald Trump: (29:39)
Yes, that’s fine.

Moderator: (29:39)
And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don’t know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?

Donald Trump: (29:56)
By Russia or anybody else.

Moderator: (29:58)
You condemn their interference?

Donald Trump: (29:59)
Of course I condemn. Of course. I don’t know Putin. I have no idea. I never met Putin. This is not my best friend, but if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn’t be so bad. Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it’s Syria, you name it, missiles. Take a look at the start-up that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, “I can’t believe they allowed us to do this.” They create warheads and we can’t. The Russians can’t believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin. And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They’ve taken over. We’ve spent $6 trillion. They’ve taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I’ve ever seen in any government whatsoever.

Moderator: (30:47)
We’re a long way away from immigration. But I’m going to let you finish this talk. You got about 45 seconds.

Donald Trump: (30:54)
And she always will be.

Hillary Clinton: (30:56)
I find it ironic that he’s raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual, about the use of nuclear weapons.

Donald Trump: (31:06)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (31:06)
He’s advocated more countries, getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He’s said, “Well, if we have them, why don’t we use them?” Which I think is terrifying. But here’s the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There’s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that’s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.

Donald Trump: (31:47)
I have 200 generals and admirals, 21 endorsing me 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody. We’re defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century. All I said is we have to renegotiate these agreements because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places we cannot continue to afford. She took that as saying nuclear weapons. Look, she’s been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie.

Moderator: (32:29)
Well, I’m just quoting you.

Donald Trump: (32:32)
There’s no quote. You’re not going to find a quote from me.

Hillary Clinton: (32:35)
When we’re asked about a potential nuclear competition in Asia, you said, “Go ahead, enjoy yourselves folks.” That kind of language-

Donald Trump: (32:43)
And defend yourselves. And defend yourself. I didn’t say nuclear and defend yourself.

Hillary Clinton: (32:49)
The United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer. And frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to keep the peace.

Moderator: (33:08)
We are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulations. We’re going to drill down into this a little bit more, but in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent’s plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (33:51)
Well, I think when the middle-class thrives America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs programs since World War II, jobs and infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses. I want us to do more to help small business. That’s where two thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage because people who live in poverty who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do. I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.

Hillary Clinton: (34:44)
That’s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt free. And for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted. And we’re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years, since the Great Recession, have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We’re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.

Hillary Clinton: (35:26)
That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts, which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald’s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose three and a half million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle down economics on steroids. So the plan I have, I think, will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.

Moderator: (36:08)
Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton?

Donald Trump: (36:14)
Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I’m a big proponent. We’re going to do a lot of things for college tuition, but the rest of the public’s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton’s plan. But I’d like to start off where we left. Because when I said Japan and Germany, and I’m not to single them out, but South Korea, those are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren’t they paying? She immediately, when she heard this, I questioned it. And I questioned NATO.

Donald Trump: (36:56)
Why aren’t the NATO questioned? Why aren’t they paying? Because they weren’t paying. Since I did this, this was a year ago. All of a sudden, they’re paying. And I’ve been given a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they’re starting to pay up, they have to pay up. We’re protecting people. They have to pay up. And I’m a big fan of NATO, but they have to pay up. She comes out and said, “We love our allies. We think our allies are great.” Well, it’s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying, “We think how great they are.” We have to tell Japan in a very nice way. We have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, “You have to help us out.” We have during his regime, during President Obama’s regime, we’ve doubled our national debt.

Donald Trump: (37:37)
We’re up to $20 trillion. So my plan, we’re going to renegotiate trade deals. We’re going to have a lot of free trade. We’re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA. One of the worst deals ever, our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left. You go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.

Donald Trump: (38:05)
We’re bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can’t make a great deal, then we’re going to terminate NAFTA. And we’re going to create new deals. We’re going to have trade, but we’re going to terminate it. We’re going to make a great trade deal. And if we can’t, we’re going to do it. We’re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We’re going to cut business taxes massively. They’re going to start hiring people. We’re going to bring the $2.5 trillion that’s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because right now our country is dying at 1% GDP.

Hillary Clinton: (38:41)
Well, let me translate that if I can, Chris, because-

Donald Trump: (38:45)
You can’t.

Hillary Clinton: (38:45)
… the fact is he’s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we’ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign, I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less. I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I’m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt. Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus. And we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.

Hillary Clinton: (39:27)
When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression, he has cut the deficit by two thirds. So yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs, is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That’s the kind of approach that will work. Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we’ve tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.

Moderator: (40:02)
Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways, it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.

Donald Trump: (40:17)
Correct.

Moderator: (40:19)
Thank you, sir. You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn’t get to do enough in what he was trying to do with this stimulus. So is your plan basically even more of the Obama stimulus?

Hillary Clinton: (40:34)
Well, it’s a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch and go situation. I was in the Senate before I became Secretary of State. I’ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy. I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn’t get the credit. He deserves for taking some very hard positions, but it was a terrible recession.

Hillary Clinton: (41:14)
So now we’ve dug ourselves out of it. We’re standing, but we’re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out, and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work. That’s why what I have put forward doesn’t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher paying jobs. We’re beginning to see some increase in incomes. And we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We’ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving. And that’s what I believe I will be able to do.

Moderator: (41:53)
Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plans, say that the numbers don’t add up, that your idea, and you’ve talked about 25 million jobs created, 4%-

Donald Trump: (42:03)
Over a 10 year period.

Moderator: (42:05)
… growth is unrealistic. And they say, you’ve talked a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that’s unrealistic as well. Your response?

Donald Trump: (42:17)
So I just left some high representatives of India. They’re growing at 8%. China is growing at 7%, and that for them is a catastrophically low number. We are growing, our last report came out, and it’s right around the 1% level. And I think it’s going down last week. As you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report, terrible jobs report. In fact, I said, “Is that the last jobs report before the election? Because of it is, I should win easily.” It was so bad. The report was so bad. Look, our country is stagnant. We’ve lost our jobs. We’ve lost our businesses. We’re not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world. I’ve visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris, I’ve gotten to know so many.

Donald Trump: (43:13)
I’ve developed so many friends over the last year and they cry when they see what’s happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago. And because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100%, it is just horrible what’s happened to these people in these communities. Now, she can say that her husband did well, but boy did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn’t really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that’s ever been signed by our country. Now, she wants to sign trans Pacific partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn’t call it the gold standard in one of the debates, she totally lied. She did call it the gold standard and they actually fact checked and they said I was right.

Moderator: (43:57)
I want to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, then I want to pivot to 1/6th of the economy-

Donald Trump: (44:01)
And that will be as bad as NAFTA.

Moderator: (44:03)
… which is Obamacare. But go ahead.

Hillary Clinton: (44:04)
Well first, let me say number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn’t meet my test. I’ve had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I’m against it now. I’ll be against it after the election. I’ll be against it when I’m President. There’s only one of us on this stage, who’s actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that’s Donald. He’s shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico, but he mentioned China. And one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.

Hillary Clinton: (44:38)
I have fought against that as a Senator, I’ve stood up against it as Secretary of state. Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steel workers, not American steel workers. That’s the kind of approach that is just not going to work. We’re going to pull the country together. We’re going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That’s why I’m going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we’re going to enforce those agreements. And we’re going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.

Moderator: (45:17)
Go ahead, Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump: (45:18)
I asked a simple question. She’s been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn’t you do it over the last 15, 20 years? You were very much involved-

Hillary Clinton: (45:27)
I voted.

Donald Trump: (45:27)
Excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it’s bad experience. Because what you’ve done has turned out badly. For 30 years, you’ve been in a position to help. And if you say that I use steel or I use something else, make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn’t mind. The problem is you talk, but you don’t get anything done, Hillary. You don’t. Just like when you ran the state department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the state department, $6 billion was either stolen, they don’t know. It’s gone. $6 billion. If you become President, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.

Hillary Clinton: (46:17)
Well, first of all, what he just said about the state department is not only untrue, it’s been debunked numerous times, but I think it’s really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience. So let me just talk briefly about that. Back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children’s Defense Fund and I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings. In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.

Hillary Clinton: (46:54)
In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said, “Women’s rights are human rights.” He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an “eating machine.” And on the day when I was in the situation room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Ladin to justice, he was hosting The Celebrity Apprentice. So I’m happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I’ve done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families, get ahead and stay ahead with your 30 years, and I’ll let the American people make that decision.

Donald Trump: (47:29)
Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets, anywhere in the world. Worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It’s a $1 million loan, but I built a phenomenal company. And if we could run our country the way I’ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it. And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria, take a look at the migration, take a look at Libya, take a look at…

Donald Trump: (48:03)
… take a look at the migration, take a look at Libya, take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS because her and Obama created this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when they… We should’ve never been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS, as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she’s going to get rid of ISIS. She’s going to get rid of nobody.

Moderator: (48:29)
All right. We are going to get to foreign hotspots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be President of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you’d never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent. Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks, make up, you denied this, why would they all make up these stories? And since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husbands did and that you defended was even worse. Mr. Trump, you go first.

Donald Trump: (49:22)
First of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people, I don’t know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it. Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence. She’s the one, and Obama, that caused the violence. They hired people, they paid them $1,500 and they’re on tape saying, “Be violent, cause fights, do bad things.” I would say the only way, because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn’t even apologize to my wife who’s sitting right here because I didn’t do anything. I didn’t know any of these women. I didn’t see these women. These women, the woman on the plane, the woman… I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it’s her campaign because what I saw, what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they’re telling people to go out and start fist fights and start violence.

Donald Trump: (50:23)
And I’ll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn’t, they get their 10 minutes of fame, but they were all totally… It was all fiction. It was lies and it was fiction.

Moderator: (50:47)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (50:48)
At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that’s exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough-

Donald Trump: (51:14)
I did not say that.

Hillary Clinton: (51:15)
For them to be assaulted-

Donald Trump: (51:17)
I did not say that.

Hillary Clinton: (51:18)
In fact, he went on to say-

Moderator: (51:21)
Her two minutes. Sir, her two minutes.

Donald Trump: (51:22)
I did not say that.

Moderator: (51:22)
It’s her two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (51:25)
He went on to say, “Look at her. I don’t think so.” About another woman, he said, “That wouldn’t be my first choice.” He attacked the woman reporter writing the story called, her disgusting, as he has called a number of women during this campaign. Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don’t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That’s who Donald is.

Hillary Clinton: (52:06)
I think it’s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don’t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other. Where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater. America is great because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true now and in the future and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.

Moderator: (52:51)
Mr. Trump-

Donald Trump: (52:52)
Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody. Nobody has more-

Moderator: (52:57)
Please everybody.

Donald Trump: (52:58)
And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different. She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn’t fictionalized are her emails, where she destroyed 33,000 emails, criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. What happened to the FBI? I don’t know. We have a great general, four star general, today, you read it in all the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She’s lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He’s going to probably go to jail. This is a four star general. And she gets away with it and she can run for the Presidency of the United States. That’s really what you should be talking about. Not fiction where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.

Moderator: (54:11)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (54:12)
Well, every time Donald is pushed on something, which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it’s not just about women. He never apologizes or says he’s sorry for anything. So we know what he has said and what he’s done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked-

Donald Trump: (54:44)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (54:44)
Him on national television. He went after Mr. And Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a gold star family, because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers people who aren’t captured. He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn’t be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican. So it’s not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark, and in many ways dangerous vision of our country. Where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is. And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what’s at stake in this election. It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.

Donald Trump: (55:53)
So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence. It’s on tape.

Moderator: (55:59)
During the last-

Donald Trump: (55:59)
The other things are false, but honestly, I’d love to talk about getting rid of ISIS. And I’d love to talk about other things. But those other charges, as she knows, there are false.

Moderator: (56:09)
In this bucket about fitness to be president, there’s been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I’d like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have. Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were Secretary of State, but emails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors. And some of those donors got government contracts, taxpayer money. Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee and why isn’t what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn’t it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?

Hillary Clinton: (57:00)
Well, everything I did as Secretary of State was in furtherance of our country’s interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that’s been proven. But I am happy, in fact I am thrilled, to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a world renowned charity, and I am so proud of the work that it does. I could talk for the rest of the debate. I know I don’t have the time to do that. But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV/AIDS to afford treatment, and that’s about half of all the people in the world who are getting treatment. In partnership with the American Health Association, we have made environments in schools healthier for kids-

Moderator: (57:44)
Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is an open discussion-

Hillary Clinton: (57:48)
Well, it is an open discussion and-

Moderator: (57:49)
I understand. And this specific question went to pay to play. Do you want to talk about that-

Hillary Clinton: (57:52)
But there is no evidence-

Moderator: (57:52)
Let’s ask Mr. Trump-

Hillary Clinton: (57:57)
There is a lot of evidence about the very good work and high ranking-

Donald Trump: (58:02)
It’s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 billion, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women’s rights. So these are people that push gays off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. So I’d like to ask you right now, why don’t you give back the money that you’ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don’t you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture. Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was in Little Haiti the other day in Florida, and I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons. Because what’s happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace and you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.

Moderator: (58:55)
Secretary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton: (58:55)
Very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90%, 90%, of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs and people around the world and in our own country. I’m very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow Foundations, and I’d be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.

Hillary Clinton: (59:25)
But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had. We’ve done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we’re going to keep working to help Haiti because it’s an important part of the American experience.

Donald Trump: (59:56)
They don’t want you to help them anymore.

Moderator: (59:59)
I want-

Donald Trump: (01:00:00)
I’d like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small Foundation, people contribute, I contribute. The money goes a hundred percent, a hundred percent goes to different charities including a lot of military. I don’t get anything. I don’t buy boats. I don’t buy planes. What happens-

Moderator: (01:00:14)
Wasn’t some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?

Donald Trump: (01:00:17)
No, we put up the American flag and that’s it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.

Moderator: (01:00:25)
There was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County and the money came from your foundation instead of Mar-a-Lago yourself-

Donald Trump: (01:00:31)
There was. And by the way, the money went to Fisher House where they build houses. The money that you’re talking about went to Fisher House where they built houses for veterans and disabled.

Moderator: (01:00:43)
I want to get into one-

Hillary Clinton: (01:00:43)
But of course, there’s no way we can know whether any of that is true because he hasn’t released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40 plus years who has not released his tax returns. So everything he says about charity or anything else, we can’t prove it. You can look at our tax returns, we’ve got them all out there. But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate, he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris, half of all immigrants, undocumented immigrants in our country, actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.

Donald Trump: (01:01:27)
So let me just tell you-

Hillary Clinton: (01:01:29)
Just astonishing.

Donald Trump: (01:01:30)
We’re entitled because of the laws that people like her pass to take massive amounts of depreciation and other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors, just about all of them, I know Buffet took hundreds of millions of dollars. Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars. Let me just explain-

Moderator: (01:01:47)
Mr. Trump-

Donald Trump: (01:01:48)
All of her donors, most of her donors, have done the same thing as I do. And you know what she should have done-

Moderator: (01:01:52)
Folks, we heard-

Donald Trump: (01:01:52)
And Hillary, what you should’ve done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States Senator-

Moderator: (01:01:57)
Folks, we heard-

Donald Trump: (01:01:58)
Because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do except even more. So you should have changed the law, but you won’t change the law because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street, known as-

Hillary Clinton: (01:02:15)
[crosstalk 01:02:15] trade with Chinese Steel.

Donald Trump: (01:02:16)
But I will tell you, I sat there, I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad, all paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you’re going to protect them. And frankly, you should have changed the laws. If you don’t like what I did, you should have changed the laws.

Moderator: (01:02:35)
Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you. Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you, his words, “Will absolutely accept the result of this election.” Today, your daughter Ivanka said the same thing. I want to ask you here on this stage tonight, do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely, sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?

Donald Trump: (01:03:13)
I will look at it at the time. I’m not looking at anything now. I’ll look at it at the time. What I’ve seen, what I’ve seen, is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pile on is so amazing that the New York Times actually wrote an article about it that they don’t even care. It’s so dishonest and they’ve poisoned the minds of the voters. But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they’re going to see through it. We’ll find out on November 8th, but I think they’re going to see-

Moderator: (01:03:41)
But sir-

Donald Trump: (01:03:43)
Excuse me, Chris, if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote, millions. This isn’t coming from me, this is coming from Pew Report in other places, millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn’t be registered to vote. So let me just give you one other thing. I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people. Tell you one other thing. She shouldn’t be allowed to run. She’s guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run. And just in that respect, I say it’s rigged. Because she should never-

Moderator: (01:04:23)
But-

Donald Trump: (01:04:23)
Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails and so many other things.

Moderator: (01:04:31)
But sir, there is a tradition in this country. In fact, one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard for what a campaign is that at the end of the campaign, that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you’re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you’re not prepared now to commit to that principle?

Donald Trump: (01:04:57)
What I am saying is that I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in suspense.

Hillary Clinton: (01:05:01)
Well, Chris, let me respond to that because that’s horrifying. Every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is is rigged against him. The FBI conducted a year long investigation into my emails. They concluded there was no case. He said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering, he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn’t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmy’s were rigged against him.

Donald Trump: (01:05:44)
Should have gotten it.

Hillary Clinton: (01:05:46)
This is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it’s funny, but it’s also really troubling. Now that is not the way our democracy works. We’ve been around for 240 years. We’ve had free and fair elections. We’ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. President Obama said the other day, “When you’re whining before the game is even finished, it just shows you’re not up to doing the job.” And let’s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating, he’s talking down our democracy. And I for one am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.

Donald Trump: (01:06:38)
I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the Attorney General, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona. I think it’s disgraceful. I think it’s a disgrace. I think we’ve never had a situation so-

Moderator: (01:06:54)
Hold on folks. This doesn’t do any good for anyone. Let’s please continue the debate and let’s move on to the subject of foreign hotspots. The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes what happens the day after? And that’s something that whichever review ends up, whoever of you ends up as President, is going to have to confront. Will you put US troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn’t come back or isn’t replaced by something even worse? Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment, you have two minutes.

Hillary Clinton: (01:07:36)
Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi Army, supported by Kurdish forces and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don’t think that is in our interests. And I don’t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself. The goal here is to take back Mosul. It’s going to be a hard fight. I’ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.

Hillary Clinton: (01:08:26)
I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a really successful military operation, but we know we’ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians continue. So I have said, “Look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.” That’s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home. Why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online. Why we have to make sure here at home, we don’t let terrorists buy weapons. If you’re too dangerous to fly, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun. And I’m going to continue to push for a no fly zone and safe havens within Syria, not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to frankly gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.

Moderator: (01:09:35)
Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, would you be willing to put US troops in there to prevent their return or something else?

Donald Trump: (01:09:47)
Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul, but when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we’re fighting again to get Mosul. Problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS, who they felt were in Mosul. About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they’re going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise? Okay. We announce we’re going after Mosul. I’ve been reading about going after Mosul now for about, how long is it Hillary three months? These people have all left. They’ve all left. The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.

Donald Trump: (01:10:35)
So we’re now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do is stay there. Now we’re going in to get it. But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she’s running for the office of President and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand and he made so many mistakes, made all mistakes. That’s why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they’re going in, but who’s going to get Mosul really? We’ll take Mosul eventually. By the way, if you look at what’s happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher, much more dangerous, going to be more deaths than they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they’re smart. They said, “What do we need this for?”

Donald Trump: (01:11:19)
So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing and Iran should write us a letter of thank you. Just like the really stupid, these stupidest deal of all time. A deal that’s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons, Iran should write us yet another letter saying, “Thank you very much.” Because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq. Something they’ve wanted to do forever, but we’ve made it so easy for them. So we’re now going to take Mosul. And you know who’s going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh yeah, they’re making, I mean, they are outsmarting… Look, you’re not there. You might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn’t have been in Iraq…

Donald Trump: (01:12:03)
… everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn’t have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn’t have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way. The point is the big winner is going to be Iran.

Hillary Clinton: (01:12:14)
Well, once again Donald is implying that he didn’t support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is a very clear fact that before the invasion he supported it.

Donald Trump: (01:12:30)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (01:12:31)
I just want everybody to go google it. Google “Donald Trump Iraq” and you’ll see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.

Donald Trump: (01:12:41)
Wrong.

Hillary Clinton: (01:12:42)
And you can hear the audio of him saying that. Why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better to contrast with me because I did vote for it. But what’s really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria, and yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, just like we went after Bin Laden while you were doing Celebrity Apprentice and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership, but we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are several thousand fighters in Mosul. They’ve been digging underground. They’ve been prepared to defend. It’s going to be tough fighting, but I think we can take back Mosul and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.

Hillary Clinton: (01:13:37)
This is what we have to do. I’m just am amazed that he seems to think the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that’s how Donald thinks. He always is looking for some conspiracy.

Donald Trump: (01:13:54)
Because we don’t gain anything. Iran is taking over Iraq [crosstalk 01:13:54].

Moderator: (01:13:54)
Secretary Clinton.

Donald Trump: (01:13:54)
Iran is taking over Iraq. We don’t gain anything.

Hillary Clinton: (01:13:55)
He has these conspiracy theories which he’s been spewing out for quite some time.

Donald Trump: (01:14:07)
We would have gained if we did it by surprise.

Moderator: (01:14:08)
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Secretary Clinton, it’s an open discussion.

Donald Trump: (01:14:09)
He says he- [crosstalk 01:14:09].

Moderator: (01:14:09)
Secretary.

Donald Trump: (01:14:09)
We would have gained if we did it by surprise.

Moderator: (01:14:09)
Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak. Go ahead.

Hillary Clinton: (01:14:11)
I think he’s unfit, and he proves it every time.

Donald Trump: (01:14:14)
No, you’re the one that’s unfit. Wikileaks just actually came out. John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and boy was he right. He said some beauties, and Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do, and if you think going into Mosul after we let the world know we’re going in and all of the people we really wanted, the leaders are all gone, if you think that was good, then you do. Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.

Hillary Clinton: (01:14:47)
Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he’s supporting for President.

Donald Trump: (01:14:50)
Which is a big mistake

Hillary Clinton: (01:14:50)
And he said, as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he’s right.

Moderator: (01:15:01)
Let’s turn to Aleppo. Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo, and I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there are-

Donald Trump: (01:15:24)
It’s a catastrophe. I mean it’s a mess.

Moderator: (01:15:24)
It is a catastrophe, there are a quarter of-

Donald Trump: (01:15:28)
Have you seen it? Have you seen it?

Moderator: (01:15:30)
Sir.

Donald Trump: (01:15:31)
Have you seen what’s happened to Aleppo?

Moderator: (01:15:33)
Sir, if I may finish my question.

Donald Trump: (01:15:34)
Okay, so it hasn’t fallen. Take a look at it.

Moderator: (01:15:36)
Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.

Donald Trump: (01:15:39)
That’s right. And they are being slaughtered because of bad decisions.

Moderator: (01:15:43)
If I may just finish here, and you also said that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who’ve been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?

Donald Trump: (01:16:03)
Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It’s a humanitarian nightmare, but it has fallen from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what’s happened. And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what’s happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she’s going to say, “Oh, he loves Assad,” he’s just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He aligned with Russia. He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.

Donald Trump: (01:16:57)
Now, he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don’t want ISIS, but they have other things, because we’re backing. We’re backing rebels. We don’t know who the rebels are. We’re giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don’t know who the rebels are. And when and if, and it’s not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now, but if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with, as bad as Assad is, and he’s a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad. If she did nothing, we’d be in much better shape. And this is what’s caused the great migration, where she’s taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases … Not probably, who are definitely-

Moderator: (01:17:47)
Let me-

Donald Trump: (01:17:47)
… in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see. This is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job.

Moderator: (01:18:02)
Secretary Clinton, you have talked about, and in the last debate and again today, that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it’s going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict, and General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you’re going to get into a war, his words, with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone, first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?

Hillary Clinton: (01:18:42)
Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I’m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation, and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground. We’ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated, so I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.

Hillary Clinton: (01:19:29)
But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He’s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in, but I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting, and so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let’s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.

Hillary Clinton: (01:20:28)
And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we’ve got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.

Moderator: (01:20:39)
Folks, I want to get into our final segment.

Donald Trump: (01:20:41)
But I just have to-

Moderator: (01:20:42)
Real quick.

Donald Trump: (01:20:43)
It’s so ridiculous. She will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they’re in 32 countries. We should have …

Moderator: (01:20:50)
Okay.

Donald Trump: (01:20:50)
Wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria, and during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don’t want the cease-fire anymore. We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn’t there. I assume she had nothing to do with it, but our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way, and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.

Moderator: (01:21:25)
Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, no. We need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight. Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77%. That’s the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86% of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105% of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first.

Donald Trump: (01:22:05)
Well, I say they’re wrong, because I’m going to create tremendous jobs, and we’re bringing GDP from, really, 1%, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we’re bringing it from 1% up to 4%. And I actually think we can go higher than 4%. I think you can go to 5% or 6%. And if we do, you don’t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we’re taking back jobs. We’re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don’t make our product anymore. It’s very sad.

Donald Trump: (01:22:46)
But I’m going to create the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We’ve given it up. We’ve become very, very sloppy. We’ve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don’t use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don’t use those people. Those are the people. These are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest business people in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals. We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they made a campaign contribution, and they’re dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people.

Donald Trump: (01:23:36)
But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven’t seen in many decades, and people, Chris, will again go back to work and they’ll make a lot of money. And we’ll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.

Moderator: (01:23:55)
Secretary Clinton?

Hillary Clinton: (01:23:55)
Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is “Make America Great Again,” I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, “Before you and President Obama were there,” I think it’s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades. Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into the middle and says, “I alone can fix it,” as he said on the convention stage.

Hillary Clinton: (01:24:49)
But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I’m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it’s one of the issues we’ve got to come to grips with. So when I talk about how we’re going to pay for education, how we’re going to invest in infrastructure, how we’re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I’ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, and there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We’ll have what economists call middle-out growth.

Hillary Clinton: (01:25:37)
We’ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That’s where growth will come from. That’s why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family, and I think that’s the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer, and we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire.

Donald Trump: (01:25:59)
Yeah, yeah, we’ve heard this before, Hillary.

Hillary Clinton: (01:26:00)
I started off with my dad was a small-business man.

Donald Trump: (01:26:03)
We’ve heard this before.

Hillary Clinton: (01:26:03)
I think it’s a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.

Moderator: (01:26:09)
Time.

Donald Trump: (01:26:10)
Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?

Moderator: (01:26:12)
Well, no, sir, because we’re running out of time.

Donald Trump: (01:26:14)
Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I’ve been waiting for years. Nobody does it right, and frankly, now we’re going to do it right.

Moderator: (01:26:24)
All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60% of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare’s going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits. So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is, and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?

Donald Trump: (01:27:13)
I’m cutting taxes. We’re going to grow the economy. It’s going to grow at a record rate of growth.

Moderator: (01:27:18)
That’s not going to help in the entitlements.

Donald Trump: (01:27:18)
No, it’s going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It’s destroying our country. It’s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year ’17, it is a disaster. If we don’t repeal and replace … Now, it’s probably going to die of its own weight, but Obamacare has to go. The premiums are going up 60%, 70%, 80%. Next year they’re going to go up over 100%. And I’m really glad that the premiums have started … At least the people see what’s happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can’t get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Moderator: (01:28:11)
And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you, as president, will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?

Hillary Clinton: (01:28:31)
Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That’s part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald’s, assuming he can’t figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund-

Donald Trump: (01:28:53)
Such a nasty woman.

Hillary Clinton: (01:28:54)
… by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system. But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare. And I’ll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, so if he repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after-

Donald Trump: (01:29:40)
Your husband disagrees with you.

Hillary Clinton: (01:29:40)
… the long-term health care drivers. We’ve got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.

Moderator: (01:29:56)
This is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you’re going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven’t prepared closing statements, so I’d like you each to take, and we’re going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it’s your turn to go first.

Hillary Clinton: (01:30:29)
Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I’m reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, and independents, because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition. I’ve been privileged to see the presidency up close, and I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life’s work. That’s what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.

Moderator: (01:31:31)
Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump?

Donald Trump: (01:31:34)
She’s raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn’t work that way. But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It’s called “Make America Great Again.” We’re going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don’t take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally better than we take care of our vets. That can’t happen.

Donald Trump: (01:32:01)
Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes. All she’s done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, “We’ll see you in four years.” We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that’s what you get when you get her.

Moderator: (01:32:41)
Thank you both. Secretary Clinton … Hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates. That brings to an end this year’s debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you. While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you, and good night.
